## Local testing of apps

It is possible to test and debug applications created in Altinn Studio on local development machine.

Currently we have not been able to provide a 100% common setup between Windows and Linux.



### Prerequisites

1. Latest [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
2. Newest [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. A code editor - we like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
    - Also install [recommended extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_workspace-recommended-extensions) (f.ex. [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) and [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome))
4. For Windows/MacOS [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
5. Update hosts file (C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts) by adding the following values. On MacOS add the same values to values /private/etc/hosts using cmd `sudo nano /private/etc/hosts`.
   ```txt
   127.0.0.1 altinn3local.no
   ```

### Setup

0. Clone the altinn-studio repository to a local folder
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio
   cd altinn-studio
   ```
1. Navigate to the `development` folder in the altinn-studio repo
   ```shell
   cd src/development
   ```
2. Setting up loadbalancer
   - **Windows:**  
     Start the loadbalancer container that routes between the local platform services and the app
     ```shell
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```
   - **Linux:**  
     Install NGINX
     ```shell
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install nginx
     sudo service nginx start
     ```
     Edit the NGINX configuration
     ```shell
     cd /etc/nginx
     sudo nano nginx.conf
     ```
     Modify the default to this:
     ```nginx
     worker_processes 1;
     events { worker_connections 1024; }

     http { 
       client_max_body_size 50M;
       sendfile on;
       
       upstream localtest {
         server 127.0.0.1:5101;
       }
       upstream app {
         server 127.0.0.1:5005;
       }
       
       server {
         listen 80;
         server_name altinn3local.no localhost;
         proxy_redirect      off;
         proxy_set_header    Host $host;
         proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

         location = / {
           proxy_pass        http://localtest/Home/;
         }
         location / {
           proxy_pass        http://app/;
         }
         location /Home/ {
           proxy_pass        http://localtest/Home/;
         }
         location /localtestresources/ {
           proxy_pass        http://localtest/localtestresources/;
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     Save and go back to src/develpment folder in altinn-studio  
     Reload NGINX configuration
     ```shell
     sudo nginx -s reload
     ```
3. Set path to app folder in local platform services:
   - Open `appSettings.json` in the `LocalTest` folder, f.ex. in Visual Studio Code
     ```shell
     cd LocalTest
     code appSettings.json
     ```
   - Change the setting `AppRepositoryBasePath` to the parent folder where you have your application repos (`C:/repos/` as an example) as  to your app on the disk.
   - Change the setting `LocalTestingStaticTestDataPath` to the full path of the altinn-studio repository.
     For example:  
     ```json
     "C:/repos/altinn-studio/src/development/TestData/"
     ```
   - Save the file.
4. Start the local platform services (make sure you are in the LocalTest folder)
   ```shell
   dotnet run
   ```
5. Navigate to the app folder (specified in the step above)
   ```shell
   cd \.\<path to app on disk>
   ```
6. Start the app locally
   ```shell
   dotnet run -p App.csproj
   ```

The app and local platform services are now running locally. The app can be accessed on <http://altinn3local.no>.

Log in with a test user, using your app name and org name. This will redirect you to the app.
