This library contains common code lists for use in Altinn 3 based applications. 

The [Getting started](#getting-started) section describes the basic steps required in order to use this package within an Altinn 3 application. For a more comprehensive description of code lists in Altinn 3 please see https://docs.altinn.studio/app/development/data/options/.

## Getting started using the package

This guide assumes you have an existing Altinn 3 application. If not please see https://docs.altinn.studio/app/getting-started/create-app/ to get started.

### 1. Add reference to [Altinn.Codelists nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Altinn.Codelists)  
   Open command line to the repo of your application and navigate to the App folder where the App.csproj file is located and run the following command:

   ```shell
   dotnet add package Altinn.Codelists
   ```
   This will add the latest stable version of the package to your solution.

   As an alternative you can edit your applications App.csproj file directly by adding the reference below to the `<itemgroup>` where you have package references. 
   ```xml
     <PackageReference Include="Altinn.Codelists" Version="0.5.0" />     
   ```
   Note that you then need to explicitly specify the version you would like. See the link on step one for available versions.

### 2. Register the codelists in your app DI container  
   Add the following to your Program.cs file:
   ```csharp
   services.AddAltinnCodelists();
   ```
   By calling this you will register all codelists accross all sources listed below in available codelists. You can also register codelists one by one if you for example would like to provide your own codelist id, or if you would like to control the mappings to description and help texts.

### 3. Connect your application to the codelist you would like to use  
   See the section below for available codelist id's.

   You can either do this using [Altinn Studio](https://altinn.studio) and configure the *Kodeliste-ID* of your component in the UI.

   Or you can configure the component by editing the optionsId property in FormLayout.json according to the [documentation](https://docs.altinn.studio/app/development/data/options/#connect-the-component-to-options-code-list)
