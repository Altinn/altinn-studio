- The access policy for role user is shown with:
  - `r`: read
  - `w`: write
  - `c`: confirm

- `REGN` refers to the accountant roles: `A0239`, `A0240`, `A0241`.
- `REVI` refers to the auditor roles: `A0237`, `A0238`.

## Testing

The policy is set up so that users with an accountant role in an organization can instantiate and fill out the data step, but do not have confirm access to either confirmation step. Users with a manager (`DAGL`) role has the same access as accountants, but also has confirm access to the first confirmation step. Users with an auditor role are only allowed to read/confirm the second confirmation step but are not allowed to instantiate, read, or fill out the data task. Everyone is allowed to see the receipt.
