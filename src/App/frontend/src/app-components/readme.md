## IMPORTANT

Components in this folder should be 'dumb', meaning the should have no knowledge about the containing app.

They should implement three things:

1. Receive and display data in the form of props.
2. Report data changes in a callback.
3. Receive and display the validity of the data.

These components will form the basis of our future component library, and will enable refactoring of the frontend app.
