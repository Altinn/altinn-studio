# Workflow Engine Integration Layer

App-lib integration with the async Workflow Engine service. The engine runs as a separate service; this code handles **sending requests** and **receiving callbacks**.

## Architecture

The Workflow Engine service (external, .NET, PostgreSQL-backed) orchestrates process transitions. This integration layer:

1. **Outbound**: `ProcessNextRequestFactory` builds a `WorkflowEnqueueEnvelope` (containing `WorkflowEnqueueRequest` body + metadata) and `WorkflowEngineClient` POSTs it to the engine's enqueue endpoint (`POST {ApiWorkflowEngineEndpoint}/{namespace}/workflows`). Namespace is sent in the URL path, idempotency key and collection key are sent via HTTP headers (`Idempotency-Key`, `Collection-Key`). Context (`AppWorkflowContext`) carries actor, lock token, org/app, and instance identification. `Namespace` = `{org}/{app}` (isolation boundary); the instance guid is sent as the `processNextInstanceGuid` label (for querying all workflows for an instance).
2. **Inbound**: The engine calls back to `WorkflowEngineCallbackController` for each command, one at a time, sequentially
3. **Per-callback lifecycle**: Controller restores `InstanceDataUnitOfWork` from the opaque state blob, resolves the `IWorkflowEngineCommand` by key, executes it, commits data changes on success, captures updated state, and returns it to the engine

```
App ProcessNext API
  → Capture workflow callback state into opaque state blob (WorkflowCallbackStateService)
  → ProcessNextRequestFactory.Create()     (builds WorkflowEnqueueRequest from ProcessStateChange)
  → WorkflowEngineClient.EnqueueWorkflow() (HTTP POST to engine, returns WorkflowEnqueueResponse.Accepted)
  → Extract workflowId from response for status polling

Engine (external service)
  → Executes steps sequentially
  → For each AppCommand: POST to /workflow-engine-callbacks/{commandKey} (echoes state blob)

WorkflowEngineCallbackController.ExecuteCommand()
  → Restore workflow callback state from state blob (WorkflowCallbackStateService)
  → Resolve IWorkflowEngineCommand by key
  → command.Execute(context)
  → Save data changes on success, capture updated state blob, return to engine
  → (Engine uses returned state blob for next callback)
```

## Key Design Constraints

- **ALL commands MUST be idempotent** - the engine retries failed commands with configurable backoff
- **Commands run in separate HTTP requests** - each callback is independent; state is passed between commands via an opaque JSON blob (see State Passthrough below)
- **Three command phases**: task-end commands → `MutateProcessState` (in-memory state transition) → task-start commands → `SaveProcessStateToStorage` (persist to Storage) → post-commit commands
- **Authentication**: Callbacks are authenticated with the `WorkflowEngineCallback` scheme. The app mints a JWT at enqueue time (signed with a `WorkflowEngineCallback` app-code, `jti` = instance guid), carries it opaquely through the engine in `AppWorkflowContext.CallbackToken`, and the engine replays it on every callback in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. A selector policy scheme (the app's default auth scheme) routes callback requests to the `WorkflowEngineCallback` scheme and all other requests to the JwtCookie scheme, so the bearer token does not collide with platform auth. The app validates signature, lifetime, and that `jti` matches the route instance. Data operations use `StorageAuthenticationMethod.ServiceOwner()`

## Command Sequences

Defined in `WorkflowCommandSet.cs`. `ProcessNextRequestFactory` assembles the full sequence:
1. Task-end/abandon commands (from `process_EndTask`/`process_AbandonTask` events)
2. `MutateProcessState` (inserted by factory if there are task-end/abandon commands)
3. Task-start and process-end commands (from `process_StartTask`/`process_EndEvent` events)
4. `SaveProcessStateToStorage` (always inserted by factory)
5. Post-commit commands

### Task-to-Task Transition (e.g., Task_1 → Task_2)
```
── instance.Process.CurrentTask = Task_1 (OLD) ──
EndTask → CommonTaskFinalization → OnTaskEndingHook → LockTaskData
  ── MutateProcessState (in-memory: CurrentTask → Task_2) ──
── instance.Process.CurrentTask = Task_2 (NEW) ──
UnlockTaskData → OnTaskStartingHook → CommonTaskInitialization → StartTask
  ── SaveProcessStateToStorage (persist to Storage) ──
MovedToAltinnEvent → [ExecuteServiceTask if service task]
```

### Task-to-End Transition (e.g., Task_1 → EndEvent)
```
── instance.Process.CurrentTask = Task_1 (OLD) ──
EndTask → CommonTaskFinalization → OnTaskEndingHook → LockTaskData
  ── MutateProcessState (in-memory: CurrentTask → null, EndEvent set) ──
OnProcessEndingHook
  ── SaveProcessStateToStorage (persist to Storage) ──
EndProcessLegacyHook → DeleteDataElementsIfConfigured → DeleteInstanceIfConfigured → CompletedAltinnEvent
```

### Initial Task Start (process just created)
```
── instance.Process.CurrentTask = Task_1 (already set by CreateInitialProcessState) ──
UnlockTaskData → OnTaskStartingHook → CommonTaskInitialization → StartTask
  ── SaveProcessStateToStorage (persist to Storage) ──
MovedToAltinnEvent → [ExecuteServiceTask if service task] → [InstanceCreatedAltinnEvent if first task] → [NotifyInstanceOwnerOnInstantiation if configured]
```

### Task Abandon (reject → end)
```
── instance.Process.CurrentTask = Task_1 (OLD) ──
AbandonTask → OnTaskAbandonHook
  ── MutateProcessState (in-memory: CurrentTask → null or next task) ──
[OnProcessEndingHook if ending] / [task-start commands if moving to next task]
  ── SaveProcessStateToStorage (persist to Storage) ──
[post-commit commands]
```

## How to Add a New Command

1. **Create the command class** in the appropriate `Commands/` subfolder:
   - Without payload: implement `IWorkflowEngineCommand` directly
   - With typed payload: extend `WorkflowEngineCommandBase<TPayload>` and create a `record TPayload : CommandRequestPayload`

2. **If using a payload**: register it in `CommandPayload.cs`:
   - Add `[JsonDerivedType(typeof(MyPayload), typeDiscriminator: "myPayload")]` to `CommandRequestPayload`
   - Add `[JsonSerializable(typeof(MyPayload))]` to `CommandPayloadJsonContext`

3. **Register in DI**: add `services.AddTransient<IWorkflowEngineCommand, MyCommand>()` in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

4. **Add to sequence**: add to the appropriate method in `WorkflowCommandSet.cs` (use `AddCommand` for pre-commit, `AddPostProcessNextCommittedCommand` for post-commit)

5. **Startup validation**: `WorkflowEngineCommandValidator` in `WorkflowEngineCommandValidator.cs` will fail at startup if a key in `WorkflowCommandSet` isn't registered in DI

## Command Conventions

- Every command has `public static string Key => "..."` and `public string GetKey() => Key`
- Commands return `SuccessfulProcessEngineCommandResult` or `FailedProcessEngineCommandResult` (never throw from Execute)
- Commands get instance data through `context.InstanceDataMutator` (an `InstanceDataUnitOfWork`)
- Commands pass `context.CancellationToken` into app-facing contexts (`ProcessTaskContext`, hook contexts, and `ServiceTaskContext`)
- The callback controller saves data changes after successful execution - commands don't need to persist data themselves (except `SaveProcessStateToStorage` which writes to the process/events API)
- Hook commands (`OnTaskStarting`, `OnTaskEnding`, `OnTaskAbandon`, `OnProcessEnding`) enforce max 1 handler per task
- `ExecuteServiceTask` can request auto-advance by returning `ServiceTaskSuccessResult` with `AutoAdvanceProcess = true`

## Interaction with Workflow Engine Service

The engine service (separate repo at `altinn-studio/src/Runtime/workflow-engine`):
- .NET service backed by PostgreSQL
- Receives `WorkflowEnqueueRequest`, stores it, executes steps sequentially
- Returns `WorkflowEnqueueResponse.Accepted` with `DatabaseId` and `Namespace` per workflow
- Calls back to the app via HTTP POST for each `AppCommand`
- Retries failed steps with configurable backoff (default: exponential, 1s base, 5min max delay, 24h max duration)
- `Namespace` = `{org}/{app}` is the primary isolation boundary; idempotency keys are unique within a namespace
- The `processNextInstanceGuid` label = `instanceGuid` groups workflows per instance for status queries
- Steps execute in order; previous step must complete before next begins
- `Context` (`AppWorkflowContext`) is opaque to the engine; passed through to command handlers
- Commands use `CommandDefinition` with `type: "app"` and `data: AppCommandData { commandKey, payload }`

### URL Patterns
- Enqueue: `POST {ApiWorkflowEngineEndpoint}/{namespace}/workflows` with `Idempotency-Key` header (required) and `Collection-Key` header (optional)
- Collection detail: `GET {ApiWorkflowEngineEndpoint}/{namespace}/collections/{collectionKey}`
- List active: `GET {ApiWorkflowEngineEndpoint}/{namespace}/workflows?label=processNextInstanceGuid:{instanceGuid}` — returns `PaginatedResponse<WorkflowStatusResponse>`
- Cancel: `POST {ApiWorkflowEngineEndpoint}/{namespace}/workflows/{workflowId}/cancel`
- Resume: `POST {ApiWorkflowEngineEndpoint}/{namespace}/workflows/{workflowId}/resume?cascade={bool}`

## State Passthrough

Each callback needs the app's workflow callback state (`instance` + `formData`). Rather than fetching from Storage on every callback (which would see stale process state), the app captures that state into an opaque `JsonElement` blob that the engine stores and echoes back with each callback.

**Capture point**: `ProcessEngine.HandleMoveToNext` captures state BEFORE `MoveProcessStateToNextAndGenerateEvents` mutates `instance.Process`. This means the blob carries the OLD process state (CurrentTask = the task being left). `MutateProcessState` transitions the in-memory state to the new task between the two command groups.

**Flow**:
1. `WorkflowCallbackStateService.CaptureState` → serializes instance + form data into `WorkflowCallbackState` → `JsonElement`
2. State blob is included in `WorkflowRequest.State`
3. Engine echoes it back in `AppCallbackPayload.State` for each callback
4. `WorkflowCallbackStateService.RestoreState` → deserializes, creates `InstanceDataUnitOfWork` with preloaded form data
5. After command execution, updated state is captured and returned in `AppCallbackResponse.State`
6. Engine uses the returned state for the next callback — state evolves command by command

**Why commands read from `instance.Process.CurrentTask`**: In the old ProcessEngine, task-end/start handlers received `taskId` as an explicit parameter (extracted from the event's `ProcessInfo`). The new commands read directly from `instance.Process.CurrentTask` instead — simpler, single source of truth. `MutateProcessState` ensures each command group sees the correct CurrentTask.

## Authorization and Data Saves (current plan)

All data saves during callbacks use `StorageAuthenticationMethod.ServiceOwner()`. This is a change from the old ProcessEngine where data operations used the end user's token.

**Current design**: The app (ServiceOwner) performs all data writes during process transitions. The user authorized the action (e.g., "confirm", "reject") at the ProcessNext API entry point. After that, the app executes the transition as ServiceOwner. This means:
- **policy.xml must grant ServiceOwner write rights on all tasks** — this is a prerequisite for the workflow engine
- Storage's authorization service checks the ServiceOwner identity (from the token), not the original user
- The task in Storage's XACML resource comes from `instance.Process.CurrentTask` as persisted in Storage's DB

**Implication for task-start data saves**: Between `MutateProcessState` and `SaveProcessStateToStorage`, task-start commands create/modify data while Storage still has the OLD task as current. This works because ServiceOwner has write access on all tasks. If Storage ever starts forwarding the real userId to the authorization service (e.g., via a header), we would need to persist the process state between the two command groups instead. The factory already separates `taskEndSteps` and `taskStartSteps`, so moving the `SaveProcessStateToStorage` insert point would be straightforward.

## Known TODOs / Notes

- `AppCallbackPayload.LockToken` naming inconsistency with engine (LockKey vs LockToken)
