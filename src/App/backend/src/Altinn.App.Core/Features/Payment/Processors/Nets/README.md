# Nets Easy integration

This folder contains the implementation of our Nets Easy payment api integration.

The client code and models are based on the following API documentation:
[Nets Easy Payment API reference](https://developer.nexigroup.com/nexi-checkout/en-EU/api/payment-v1/).

### API Models Information

The models used in API calls to Nets Easy were manually created based on the JSON examples in the Nets API
documentation. Since they were written by hand, there might be some unintentional differences from the actual API
objects (bugs).

Refer back to the official API docs for the most up-to-date information.
