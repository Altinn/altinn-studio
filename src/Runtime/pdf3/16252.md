### Description

Currently when we generate a PDF, we simply wait for the presence of an element with `[id=readyForPrint]`. This ensures that we don't print before things have finished loading. However, if a fatal error occurs (resulting in e.g. the unknown error page), this element will never be visible. Therefore, we have a timeout of 30 seconds. This has always been really annoying, having to wait 30s to be able to retry. Additionally, this hoards capacity from other requests which could otherwise be made in that time.

In addition to waiting for a selector, we should support failing on a selector, so that the page itself can report in the DOM if such an unrecoverable error has occured so that we can detect it an give up immediately.

In https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react/pull/3840, we added the data-attribute `data-fatal-error` to what we consider unrecoverable errors, and makes sure not to show `#readyForPrint` in that case. We could also listen to this attribute directly in the PDF-generator.

- Should we expand the API to support custom selectors here? Just like `waitForSelector`?
- Should we hardcode the selector `[data-fatal-error]` (by default) to just use this immediately for all apps with a sufficiently up to date app-frontend version?
