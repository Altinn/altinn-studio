# Getting Started with JSON Schema Editor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running/testing JSON Schema Editor locally

The Schema editor is set up to be a package, and is currently not set up to run in development mode locally.
To run the Schema editor while developing, use the styleguide that has been set up for the components.

### npx styleguidist server

Will start the styleguide in dev mode.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build-rollup`

Builds the app as a package for production to the `dist` folder.\
