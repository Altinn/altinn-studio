## Backend Stack

Altinn Studio Designer's backend is built using the following technologies:

- .NET 9 (ASP.NET Core Web API)
- Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL
- SignalR for real-time communication
- MediatR for CQRS/mediator pattern
- Kafka for event streaming and integration
- Redis for caching and SignalR backplane
- Quartz for background job scheduling
- LibGit2Sharp for Git repository operations
- xUnit with Moq for unit testing
- Testcontainers for integration testing
- Docker support for containerization

## Project Structure

The backend consists of three main projects in a Visual Studio solution:

### Core Projects

- **`src/Designer/`** - Main ASP.NET Core Web API application containing:
    - `Controllers/` - API endpoints organized by feature area
    - `Services/` - Business logic and domain services
    - `Models/` - Data models, DTOs, and domain objects
    - `Infrastructure/` - Cross-cutting concerns (auth, git repositories, configuration)
    - `Repository` - App scope, release and deployment database interactions
    - `EventHandlers/` - MediatR event handlers for domain events
    - `Hubs/` - SignalR hubs for real-time communication
    - `Migrations/` - Entity Framework database migrations
    - `Scheduling/` - Quartz background job definitions

- **`src/DataModeling/`** - Data modeling and schema conversion library:
    - `Converter/` - Converts between JSON Schema, XSD, and C# models
    - `Json/` - JSON Schema processing and validation
    - `Metamodel/` - Internal data model representation
    - `Templates/` - Code generation templates
    - `Validator/` - Schema validation logic

- **`PolicyAdmin/`** - Policy and authorization management:
    - `Models/` - XACML policy models
    - `PolicyConverter.cs` - Policy format conversions

### Test Projects

- **`tests/Designer.Tests/`** - Unit and integration tests for main Designer project
- **`tests/DataModeling.Tests/`** - Tests for data modeling functionality
- **`tests/SharedResources.Tests/`** - Shared testing utilities

## Development Commands

### Build & Run

- `dotnet build` - Build the solution
- `dotnet run --project src/Designer` - Run the Designer API
- `dotnet watch --project src/Designer` - Run with hot reload

### Testing

- `dotnet test` - Run all tests
- `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PartlyMatchingTestName"` - Run specific tests

## Testing Guidelines

- Mock external dependencies using `Moq`
- Follow Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
- Place test files in same folder structure as source files
- Use test helpers in `./tests/Designer.Tests/Utils/TestDataHelper.cs` when possible
- Use mocked repositories located in `./tests/Designer.Tests/_TestData/Repositories/testUser/ttd` when applicable
