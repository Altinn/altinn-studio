  StudioBlobDownloader
</Heading>
<Paragraph>
  StudioBlobDownloader renders a button that triggers the download of data in the specified file
  format. The data is generated on-demand when the user clicks the download button, which is ideal
  for expensive transformations or dynamic data that should only be computed when actually needed.

  Basic Usage
</Heading>
<Paragraph>
  Use the `getData` prop to provide a function that returns the data to download. This function will
  only be called when the user clicks the download button.

  Lazy Generation
</Heading>
<Paragraph>
  When dealing with expensive data transformations or large datasets, the lazy evaluation approach
  ensures optimal performance. The data is only generated when the user actually wants to download
  it, preventing unnecessary computations during component rendering.

<Heading level={2} size='xsmall'>
  Complex Data
</Heading>
<Paragraph>
  The component works well with complex data structures. Each time the download button is clicked,
  `getData` is called to generate fresh data.
