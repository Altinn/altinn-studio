## POC for modal to add component - used for live user testing

We implemented a POC of an alternative way of adding components. All files in this enclosing folder are part of the POC.
Please note that not all components/code in this folder is implemented according to our development guidelines, on account
of it being a POC. If we decide to use these files going forward after the user test, some refactoring and cleanup should be
done.

If we at some point after the user test decide not to go forward with the concept, or to implement it in a different way, we can
delete this folder.

The component `AddItemModal.tsx` is used in the file `FormLayout.tsx`.
