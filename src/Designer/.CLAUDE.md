# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code.

## Project Overview

This is Altinn Studio Designer - a React/.NET application where users create applications for Norwegian government services, including tools for creating dynamic forms.

Documentation for the project can be found at https://docs.altinn.studio/.

## Coding Conventions

- Avoid hard coded numbers and strings
- Use meaningful and descriptive names, and avoid abbreviations
- Use comments sparingly - only use them for what the code cannot express
- Write short functions that only do one thing
