## Project Overview

This is Altinn Studio Designer - a React/.NET application where users create applications for Norwegian government services, including tools for creating dynamic forms.

Documentation for the project can be found at [docs.altinn.studio](https://docs.altinn.studio/).

## Coding Conventions

- Avoid hard-coded numbers and strings
- Use meaningful and descriptive names, and avoid abbreviations
- Use comments sparingly â€” only use them for what the code cannot express
- Write short functions that only do one thing
