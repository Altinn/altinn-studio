Test IIE003 tests that policies included via PolicyIdReference
are evaluated only when the PolicySet's combining algorithm calls
for them to be evaluated.  That is, the referenced policies must
not be evaluated (or syntax- and type-checked) until the
evaluation of the PolicySet calls for evaluation of the
referenced policy.

The base PolicySet in IIE003Policy.xml refers to two policies:
 a. IIE003PolicyId1.xml
 b. IIE003PolicyId2.xml
IIE003PolicyId2.xml contains a type mis-match and thus is an
invalid policy file.

The base PolicySet uses "FirstApplicable", and the policy in
IIE003PolicyId1.xml is applicable, so the policy in
IIE003PolicyId2.xml should never be evaluated as part of
evaluating a Request.

This test may be passed in either of two ways:

1. If your implementation does schema- and type-checks on
   policies independently of their use in evaluating policies
   against a specific request, then

   a. Verify that the policy in IIE003PolicyId2.xml fails
      validity checks, and thus would never be made available to
      the PDP as part of evaluating a Request.

   b. Make the policy in IIE003PolicyId1.xml available to the PDP
      using whatever mechanism your implementation uses to
      resolve PolicyIdReference references.

   c. Evaluate the request in IIE003Request.xml (or its semantic
      equivalent) against the base policy in IIE003Policy.xml.
      The result must be match (or be semantically equivalent to)
      the response in IIE003Response.xml.  You must NOT get any
      errors due to the policy in IIE003PolicyId2.xml.

2. If your implementation does schema- and type-checks on
   policies as the policies are evaluated in response to a
   specific request, then

   a. Make the policies in IIE003PolicyId1.xml and
      IIE003PolicyId2.xml available to the PDP using whatever
      mechanism your implementation uses to resolve
      PolicyIdReference references.

   b. Evaluate the request in IIE003Request.xml (or its semantic
      equivalent) against the base policy in IIE003Policy.xml.
      The result must be match (or be semantically equivalent to)
      the response in IIE003Response.xml.  You must NOT get a
      result of INDETERMINATE, since IIE003PolicyId2.xml should
      never be evaluated.
