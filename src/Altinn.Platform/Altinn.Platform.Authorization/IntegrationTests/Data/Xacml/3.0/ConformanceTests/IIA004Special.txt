Special Instructions for Test Case II.A.4

The policy for this test contains a syntax error.

If an initial policy with invalid syntax MAY EVER be evaluated by
the implementation's XACML PDP at the time a Request is received,
then this test MUST be passed.  In this case, the result MUST be
consistent with the supplied IIA004Response.xml file: it returns
a Decision of Indeterminate with a StatusCode value of
"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:syntax-error".

If the implementation's XACML PDP CAN NEVER attempt to evaluate
an initial policy with invalid syntax, then the implementation
MUST demonstrate that the policy in IIA004Policy.xml will be
rejected by whatever entity is responsible for validating policy
syntax in the system in which the XACML PDP will be used.  In
this case, the supplied Request and Response files are not
relevant and may be ignored.
