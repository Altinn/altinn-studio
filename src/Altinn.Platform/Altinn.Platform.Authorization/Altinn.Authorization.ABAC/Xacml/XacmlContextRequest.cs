    /// policy evaluation in terms of operations on the context.  However a conforming PDP is not required to actually instantiate the context
    /// in the form of an XML document.  But, any system conforming to the XACML specification MUST produce exactly the same authorization decisions as
    /// if all the inputs had been transformed into the form of an <Request/> element.
    /// The<Request/> element contains<Attributes/> elements.There may be multiple<Attributes/> elements with the same
    /// Category attribute if the PDP implements the multiple decision profile, see[Multi].  Under other conditions,
    /// it is a syntax error if there are multiple<Attributes/> elements with the same Category (see Section 7.19.2 for error codes).
    ///
    /// The <Request/> element is of RequestType complex type.
    /// The<Request/> element contains the following elements and attributes:
    ///
    /// ReturnPolicyIdList[Required]
    /// This attribute is used to request that the PDP return a list of all fully applicable policies and policy sets which were used
    /// in the decision as a part of the decision response.
    ///
    /// CombinedDecision [Required]
    /// This attribute is used to request that the PDP combines multiple decisions into a single decision.The use of this attribute
    /// is specified in [Multi]. If the PDP does not implement the relevant functionality in [Multi], then the PDP must return an
    /// Indeterminate with a status code of urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:processing-error if it receives a request with this attribute set to “true”.
    ///
    /// <RequestDefaults/> [Optional]
    /// Contains default values for the request, such as XPath version. See section 5.43.
    ///

    /// Specifies information about attributes of the request context by listing a sequence of<Attribute/>
    /// elements associated with an attribute category.One or more<Attributes/> elements are allowed.
