Test IID030 applies only to PDPs that retrieve their initial
policies from a repository, where multiple initial policies might
be obtained based on <Target> matching.  IID030Policy1.xml and
IID030Policy2.xml must be stored in the repository, such that
both policies will be considered for application to the Request
in IID030Request.xml.

Any PDP that has only one initial policy, regardless of the
Request, does not need to pass this test.
