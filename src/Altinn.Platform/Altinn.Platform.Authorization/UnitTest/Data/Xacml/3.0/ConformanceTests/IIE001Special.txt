Test IIE001 requires the PDP to be able to obtain a Policy with
PolicyId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:conformance-test:IIE001:policy1" and a
PolicySet with PolicySetId="conformance-test:IIE001:policyset1"
from its policy repository.  These policies are provided in files
IIE001PolicyId1.xml and IIE001PolicySetId1.xml, respectively.

In order to execute this test, the policy in file
IIE001PolicyId1.xml and the policy set in file
IIE001PolicySetId1.xml must be stored in a repository such that
the PDP (or its Policy Retrieval Point) is able to fetch the
respective policies when they are referenced by id by
IIE001Policy.xml.
