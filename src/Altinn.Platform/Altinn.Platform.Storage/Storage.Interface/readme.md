## Instance

Attribute | Eiriks suggested name | Description
---| --- | ---
instanceOwnerId | partyId | Eirik suggests instanceOwnerPartyId, which is no simplification
instanceOwnerLookup | instanceOwner | This makes sense if we store personNumber/organsiationNumber in instance. But not if we are going to "forget" personNumber.
storageUrl | blobStoragePath | since Url is misunderstood
instanceStatus | instanceOwnerStatus | inbox properties


move labels to AppOwner section
presentation field has multilang support
