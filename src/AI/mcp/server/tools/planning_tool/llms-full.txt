## Altinn 3 Correspondence Roadmap
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Apr 8, 2025

# News and plans

News and plans for development of Altinn 3 Correspondence.

## Migration from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 Correspondence

The Altinn 2 Correpondence solutions is being reimplemented along with other solutions on the Altinn platform
to transition to a new technology platform and improved services in Altinn 3.

The development of the Altinn 3 Melding solution began in the spring of 2024. By mid-2026,
service owners and users should be transitioned to the new solution.
The Altinn 2 platform will then be shut down.

## Planned new and changed features for Altinn 3 Correspondence

### The Key New Features in Altinn 3 Correspondence (Preliminary Overview)

- Improved end-user experience through a new user interface in the Shared Workspace.
- Support for sending links to message content and attachments
as an alternative to sending message content and attachments directly in the messages.
The files can be stored in the Altinn 3 Melding File Storage or in the sender’s preferred solution.
- Functionality for uploading and securely storing attachments,
with the possibility of reuse across multiple messages.
- Improved authorization through Altinn 3 Authorization.
- Some API changes.

### Deprecated Functionality in Altinn 3 Correspondence (Preliminary Overview)

- The old batch-based messaging solution is being deprecated.
Distribution of messages to many recipients is instead supported through other mechanisms,
such as linking to attachments and scalable performance in isolated rooms (multitenant architecture).

## SmartCloud System User Integration
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# SmartCloud - Altinn Reference Implementation

Reference implementation for integrating System User functionality into end-user systems.

SmartCloud demonstrates how system vendors can integrate System User functionality into their products, including:

- Creating a system user token from Maskinporten
- Using system user tokens to call public APIs
- Registering requests for creating system users
- Checking the status of system user requests
- Listing all system users for a system

## Creating a System User Request

End users can sign up as users for SmartCloud. Depending on the SmartCloud version, different rights will be requested.

The request is sent from the [Redirect controller](https://github.com/TheTechArch/altinn-systemuser/blob/main/src/SystemUserClientSystem/SuperSystem/SuperSystem.Server/Controllers/RedirectController.cs#L35). The rights requested vary based on the product.

SmartCloud authenticates with Maskinporten and requests a token with the scope **altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.write**.

## Creating a Maskinporten System User Token

SmartCloud includes code to generate a Maskinporten token for system users using the “logged in” organization number.

## Calling APIs with System User Token

With the generated system user token, SmartCloud can call various APIs.

- The [LogisticController](https://github.com/TheTechArch/altinn-systemuser/blob/main/src/SystemUserClientSystem/SuperSystem/SuperSystem.Server/Controllers/LogisticController.cs) calls the Logistics API, requiring read access for the resource.

The project can be studied [here](https://github.com/TheTechArch/altinn-systemuser/tree/main/src/SystemUserClientSystem/SuperSystem).

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Redux

Redux is used for handling state in React applications.

- Applikasjonstilstandshåndtering
- En felles tilstand for hele applikasjonen
- Tilstanden styres av Actions som håndteres av Reducere som igjen populerer tilstanden.
  - En Action kan f.eks. være **“FETCH\_POSTNUMMER”**
  - Når en slik actions kjøres, så vil en Reducer ta imot og oppdatere tilstanden slik at det er i tilstanden at applikasjonen nå henter postnummer.
  - Når er hentingen er fullført, vil man f.eks. sende en action **“FETCH\_POSTNUMMER\_FULFILLED”** som har postnummer-data med som parameter.
  - Reducer håndterer denne handlingen og setter postnummer-data i applikasjonens tilstand.
- Vedlikeholdt av Facebook, under MIT lisens.

## Fordeler ved å bruke redux

- En felles state for alle komponenter
- Komponenter kan kobles direkte mot state og kan oppdatere denne uavhengig av andre komponenter
- Gir en stor frihet til valg av struktur på state.
- Enkelt å eksportere til json og importere fra json (hvis strukturen er lik)

## TypeScript in Altinn Studio

# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.

[![TypeScript logo](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/typescript/typescript-logo.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/typescript/typescript-logo.png) _TypeScript logo_

Med javascript er følgende en lovlig handling:

```javascript hljs
var foo = false;
foo = "bar";

```

Dette ville gitt en TypeError i TypeScript, og koden ville ikke blitt kompilert til JavaScript.

Typescript kompileres til JavaScript, så klienten kjører aldri TypeScript koden.
Typescript er til for at utvikleren ikke skal lage bugs ved å endre typer på variabler.

## Altinn App Validation Endpoints
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 12, 2024

# Validation

The validation API endpoints for instances and data elements.

## Overview

There are multiple endpoints that can trigger validation and provide feedback regarding the state of an instance and its data.
Some of them validates data already uploaded and stored in Altinn while others can validate input.

## Validate stored instance

This action will validate an entire instance including the all data elements already uploaded and stored in Altinn.
Validation will be performed based on current task in the process. Validation will ensure that all required data elements, as defined by the application metadata,
have been uploaded and are valid.
If the result of the validation is that nothing is missing or wrong, the action will update the instance with information indicating that the instance is valid.
The response will be an empty array. In the case of validation issues the response will provide an array of the identified issues.
Validation of a full instance use validation of data as described in the chapter below.

```http hljs
GET https://{org}.apps.at21.altinn.cloud/{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceId}/validate

```

Example response:

```json hljs
[\
    {\
        "severity": "Error",\
        "scope": "INSTANCE",\
        "targetId": null,\
        "field": null,\
        "code": "TooManyDataElementsOfType",\
        "description": "TooManyDataElementsOfType"\
    }\
]

```

## Validate stored data

This action will validate a specific data element already uploaded and stored in Altinn.
The logic validates that the data element has the correct Content-Type, that it isn’t too large and so on. Data elements with
a model bound to them will be validated against the model (Schema).

Validation will also check that the data element being validated is required for the current task in the process.
If the data is validated during a task different from what is intended, the validator will give a warning.

```http hljs
GET https://{org}.apps.at21.altinn.cloud/{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceId}/data/{dataid}/validate

```

Example response:

```json hljs
[\
    {\
        "severity": "Error",\
        "scope": "default",\
        "targetId": null,\
        "field": null,\
        "code": "MissingContentType",\
        "description": "MissingContentType"\
    }\
]

```

### Validate data

The application will provide a method to validate the datamodel without creating a instance of the data. Data must be provided as form data.
The validate method takes a data file of an dataType and performs validation on that file. It returns a validation report.

## Altinn Authentication Overview
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Authentication

The authentication component provides functionality to authenticate users and systems accessing Altinn Apps and Altinn platform.

The authentication component does not function as an identity provider itself; instead, it establishes authentication sessions based on external identity providers such as:

- [ID-porten](https://eid.difi.no/en/id-porten)
- [Maskinporten](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/maskinporten/maskinporten/25)
- [Feide](https://www.feide.no/)

The authentication component generates JWT tokens containing claims about the user and system, based on authentication information provided by external identity providers.

Repository for Altinn Authentication can be found [here](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authentication).

Backlog with open issues can be found [here](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authentication/issues).

## Token exchange for Altinn Portal

When a user logs in to the Altinn Portal (Legacy Solution) it gets a Cookie containing information about the logged-in user. This cookie is
a [proprietary format for ASP.NET](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/301240/how-to-implement-forms-based-authentication-in-your-asp-net-applicatio) (Full Framework)
and can only be understood with application based on .NET Framework having access to the symmetric encryption key.

The Altinn Platform is based on .ASP.NET Core and can’t understand the cookie.

To allow for a user accessing an App in Altinn Apps or a component in Altinn Platform the current platform will
expose an API that can decrypt an ASP.NET cookie and return user information to the Authentication component in Altinn Platform.

## Token exchange for Maskinporten

Organizations authenticated in Maskinporten can exchange their JWT token for a valid Altinn Platform JWT token to be used against Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform.

## Token exchange for ID-porten

End users authenticated through ID-porten can exchange their JWT token for a valid Altinn Platform JWT token to be used against Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform.

The solution is available at [https://platform.altinn.cloud/authentication/api/v1](https://platform.altinn.cloud/authentication/api/v1).

## Authenticate user

The authentication resource enables authenticating a user and redirecting it to another Altinn-url.
If the user is not authenticated already it will be sent to the login page before redirecting the user to its final destination {url}.

```http hljs
GET /authentication?goto={url}

```

## Refresh a valid JwtToken

```http hljs
GET /refresh

```

## Exchange a JWT token from an external token provider

Accepted providers include: `maskinporten` and `id-porten`.
Request must include a bearer token in the authorization header.
Set test equal to true if retrieving a token for Testdepartementet.
(This ony works with Maskinporten as the token provider.)

A token from id-porten contains both an id-token and access-token.
Only the access token is to be exchanged using this endpoint.

```http hljs
GET /exchange/{tokenProvider}?test={bool}

```

## Architecture

See [application construction components](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/reference/architecture/)
for details how this component is constructued.

## Dialogporten Service Overview
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# About Dialogporten

A brief introduction to Dialogporten.

## What is Dialogporten?

Dialogporten is a solution which serves as a common API and metadata state store for digital dialogs. The primary goal of Dialogporten is to facilitate secure and efficient communication between public service platforms (such as Altinn) and users by providing a standardized way to handle digital dialogs and messages. This involves managing the metadata associated with these dialogs and ensuring interoperability across different systems.

## What is stored in Dialogporten?

Dialogporten contains “dialogs”, which are representations of a particular instance of a digital service. A dialog consists of a sender (usually a government actor), a recipient (a citizen or organization) and a reference to a digital service definition in [Altinn Resource Registry](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/what-do-you-get/resourceregistry/), which itself contains information about the service itself as well as authorization policies governing its use.

In addition, a dialog contains some content used to describe to end users the state of the dialog and give information on what the user should do (if anything), such as a title field, a short summary text, and activity history showing the various actions performed and state changes throughout the life-time of the dialog.

## What is not stored in Dialogporten?

Actual content, such as body texts, forms, form data entered by users, attachments etc. are not included in the dialog, but merely _referenced_ using URLs pointing to the resources at the digital service platform in which the service is realized.

## How does this work?

Dialogporten operates on a read-only basis
1
for end users. The digital service platforms (e.g., Altinn), which we refer to as “service providers”, on behalf of a service owner (the government actor), performs the writes to the dialog. This means that while users can view the state and metadata of their dialogs through Dialogporten, any updates or actions are managed and recorded by the service platform itself - usually in sync with the user interacting with the relevant service, e.g., filling out or submitting a form. This ensures that data remains consistent and secure across all systems involved.

1There are two exceptions; [dialog labels](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/dialogs/#dialog-labels), which users can assign in order to keep the dialogs organized, and the [seen log](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/seen-log) which keeps track of user access to dialogs.

## How do app developers in Altinn use Dialogporten?

The Altinn platform will automatically make all app [instances](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/api/models/instance/) and [correspondence](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/correspondence/) available in Dialogporten, exposing relevant information and actions, and will update the representation as the app instance/correspondence gets updated.

For additional control, the [app template](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/app-template) utilizes a [Dialogporten API client](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/user-guides/service-owners/api-client/) that enables the app to take full control on how the app is represented in Dialogporten, and thus portals like Altinn Inbox (“arbeidsflate”).

The app template integration is under development. For now, app developers must utilize the [Dialogporten API client NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Altinn.ApiClients.Dialogporten) directly.

## Where do the user find the dialogs?

Users can access their dialogs by logging in to altinn.no and navigating to their “arbeidsflate”, which is the common Dialogporten frontend (previosuly called “inbox”). This utilizes Dialogporten end-user APIs to search for and view dialogs and visualizes the dialogs, providing users with an intuitive interface to manage their interactions. Additionally, other end-user systems can utilize the same APIs to create tailored user experiences, allowing for flexible integration with various service provider platforms.

The next generation of the Altinn “inbox” GUI is under development and not currently available. Track the progress of the “Arbeidsflate” development in the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/8/views/28)

## Altinn 2-3 Broker Transition
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Technical Overview

The Altinn 3 Broker Transition Solution allows service owners who own broker services in Altinn 2 to point those services towards Altinn 3 using an internal Altinn 2 bridge.

## About

The Altinn 3 Broker Transition service bridge is an internal component in Altinn 2 that transfers Broker requests from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 for a given request, based on the ServiceCode/ServiceEditionCode combination of the request.
This is an implementation of the soft shift solution described [here](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/broker/reference/solution-architecture/#soft-shift-from-altinn-2-to-altinn-3).

## Technical overview

Altinn 2 allows end users in Altinn 2 to make BrokerService requests for specific Broker Services that will be transferred to Altinn 3 instead of being stored in Altinn 2.
Files transferred in this way will be available for Altinn 3 and Altinn 2 users.

Authentication and authorization are primarily performed at the API endpoint being called (Altinn 2 or 3). For Altinn 2, authentication/authorization is performed at the service level before routing the service calls to Altinn 3 through a dedicated endpoint that can assume service-level authentication and authorization are OK. For Altinn 3, everything happens internally within the environment.
This means that you need both an Altinn 2 service (with associated authorization rules and setup in SRR) and an Altinn 3 Broker Resource with access defined in the Resource Registry.
This is a natural pattern when setting up a transition solution for an existing service, but it is worth noting if you want to set up dedicated test services.

1. Requests that have the ability to specify ServiceCode / ServiceEdition.
In this case Altinn will immediately determine that the request should be transferred to Altinn 3 via the Altinn 3 Broker Bridge.
In cases where the SC/SE can be specified, but aren’t, requests will not be transferred to Altinn 3.
2. Requests that do not have the ability to specify SC/SE.
In this case a call will first be made to Altinn 2 Broker storage. If nothing is found in Altinn 2, a call will be made to Altinn 3.
3. Files in Altinn 3 cannot be larger than 1 GB, as this is the maximum file size in Altinn 2. The Altinn 3 Resource should be configured with this max filesize restriction.
4. File data and metadata will be stored in the Altinn 3 store, while Altinn 2 will simply call Altinn 3.
5. Receipts will no longer be stored in Altinn 2, instead a pseudo receipt (with receiptId 0) will be generated from Altinn 3 Metadata in the relevant Broker-specific operations.
The Receipt endpoint in Altinn 2 will as such no longer be able to be used to access receipts for Broker, as they do not exist..
**If you require the use of Receipt endpoint, please submit a feature request with detailed examples and we will look into a solution.**
6. The use of Manifest file in the submitted file data is deprecated in Altinn 3; but you may enable functionality for Manifest files in the transition solution. See [description below](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/broker/broker-transition/technical-overview/#manifest-file) for details.

![Broker Transition Solution Flowchart](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/broker/broker-transition/technical-overview/altinn3-broker-transition-flowchart.svg)

## Switch Over - What to expect

When the Altinn 3 Broker Transition Solution feature is enabled in Altinn 2, the following occurs:

1. ServiceOwners can request that Altinn 2 Broker Services be transitioned to Altinn 3 Resources.
2. End users that use these services will then transmit data to Altinn 3 instead of Altinn 2 data stores.
3. Files that were available in Altinn 2 for the Broker Service will no longer be available.
4. All new files and status changes will occur in the Altinn 3 Broker Service Solution.
5. ServiceOwners with transitioned Broker Services will have to manage changes in access rights in both Altinn 3 and Altinn 2 simultaneously, as these are not automatically synchronized.

### Manifest file

Due to the manifest files being deprecated in Altinn 3, we have added a feature to enable creation/update of manifest files for the transition solution.
The feature is implemented as part of the Download operation from the Altinn 2 side, and due to greater performance impact, is disabled by default.
To enable this feature you need to [configure the Altinn 3 Resource](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/broker/broker-transition/getting-started/#configure-resource-for-transition-solution) with the properties:

- UseManifestFileShim = true
- ExternalServiceCodeLegacy = The External Service Code of the Altinn 2 legacy service, this is only used to build the Manifest xml, and will not affect any other functionality.
- ExternalServiceEditionCodeLegacy = The External Service Edition Code of the Altinn 2 legacy service, this is only used to build the Manifest xml, and will not affect any other functionality.

The manifest file is created based upon the “PropertyList” specified when initializing a file transfer, as well ExternalServiceCodeLegacy and ExternalServiceEditionCodeLegacy specified on the Resource.
The optional list “FileList” will no longer be created as part of the manifest.

**Example Manifest file:**

```xml hljs
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<BrokerServiceManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://schema.altinn.no/services/ServiceEngine/Broker/2015/06">

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Architecture Capabilities

Architecture Capabilities are the logical building blocks of the solutions. They have been grouped into Development & Operations (DevOps) Capabilities and Runtime (Execution) Capabilities.

Functional capabilities are described in the functional description of the [solutions](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/solutions/).

### Runtime capabilities

The runtime capabilities describe the architecture capabilities the different solutions provide during runtime operations.

An example could be authorization. The architecture provides the capability to authorize access to resources.

Since Altinn 3 is a platform letting its users develop applications and deploy them, you will see that many capabilities that
typical is DevOps capabilities in other projects, is part of the runtime capabilities. An example of this is the capability to build and deploy applications

[Learn more about Altinn 3 runtime capabilities](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/capabilities/runtime/).

### DevOps capabilities

To develop and operate a large platform like Altinn 3 requires many different capabilities.

Some capabilities are provided by application and tools and other is provided by processes performed by the DevOps team.

An example capability is to be able to configure the infrastructure.

## Altinn Event Subject Authorization
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Understanding Subjects in Cloud Events

Exploring the role of the subject field in generic cloud events and its importance in event processing and authorization within Altinn.

## The Subject in Cloud Events

In generic cloud events, Altinn does not alter the event data and does not require specific knowledge of the event’s details or entities.
The subject field in Altinn can represent various entities, such as parties or individuals.
For example, if an event triggers when a party updates their information, the subject could be `/party/{partyId}`.
However, in different contexts, the subject might refer to entities like airports or weather stations.

## Choosing the Right Subject

When selecting a subject for your events, keep the following principles in mind:

- **Relevance**: The subject should directly relate to the event content.
For instance, if the event concerns a party, the subject should identify that specific party.

- **Uniqueness**: Use identifiers like `partyId` or `organizationNumber` to uniquely identify the entity referenced by the subject.

- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent format for subject fields across all events.
This consistency aids consumers in understanding and processing events effectively.


## Authorization and Subject Management

Altinn Events enable seamless publication and subscription across different contexts,
leveraging Altinn Authorization for robust access control.

Upon receiving an event, our system verifies the sender’s permissions
based on the XACML policy associated with the Altinn application or resource.

Similarly, when a system requests event access via subscription or polling,
the system’s rights are validated against the policy to ensure alignment with the event’s subject.

For example, consider scenarios where systems consume events related to their own context.
If a system attempts to consume an event with a mismatched subject, authorization fails.
The XACML policy ensures that only events relevant to the consuming system are accessed, maintaining data integrity and security.

Choosing the correct subject is crucial as incorrect subjects can lead to event rejection due to failed authorization checks.

## Types of Subjects Supported by Altinn Authorization

When a subject is included in a published cloud event or subscription filter,
Altinn Authorization evaluates whether publishing or consumption is authorized.

Altinn supports predefined subject types that enrich authorization requests
with detailed rights and roles information, such as `partyId` or `organizationNumber`.

### Default Subject Types

Altinn offers several default subject types, formatted as string constants:

- User: Represents a user subject. Format: ( `/user/{userId}`).
- Org (service owner): Represents a Altinn service owner subject. Format: ( `/org/{orgId}`).
- Party: Represents a party subject. Format: ( `/party/{partyId}`).
- Organization: Represents an organization subject. Format: ( `/organisation/{organisationId}`).

### URN Subject Types

URN (Uniform Resource Name) subject types are also supported:

- Organization: Represents an organization. Format: `urn:altinn:organization:identifier-no:{organization number}`
- Person: Represents a person. Format: `urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:{national identity number}`

### Generic URN Support

Altinn allows for flexible definition of generic URN subject types, accommodating custom requirements beyond predefined types.
Ensure URNs conform to the syntax standards defined in [RFC 2141](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2141).

However, it’s crucial to note: If the subject is pivotal for authorization, there must be a strict 1:1 correspondence between the subject attribute
in your policy and the subject defined in the cloud event or subscription.
Altinn Authorization does not enrich data for generic URNs that are not predefined.

# API

The apps developed in Altinn Studio can expose both standard and custom APIs, and take advantage of APIs. Here are guides on how to do it.

The app’s APIs are documented with OpenAPI. There are two variants of the OpenAPI specification:

- Generic app API – exposes all endpoints regardless of the specific configuration of the app.
- App-specific API – exposes a reduced set of APIs, where several are relevant for end-user systems (available since v8.6).

Both are available at the following URL:

`https://<org>.apps.<env>.altinn.no/<org>/<app>/swagger`

There are APIs that are not described in an OpenAPI specification. These may be intended for internal use, and we may therefore make undocumented changes to these as needed.

- [Authentication](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/api/auth/)
When it comes to authentication, there are some configurations that may be relevant

- [Consume APIs in an app](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/api/consume/)
An application can consume open and closed APIs available through the Internet.

- [Exposing APIs from an app](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/api/expose/)
More APIs can be added than what is defined as the default API for applications developed in Altinn Studio.

- [Instance](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/api/instance/)

# Reference Implementation System User API

Reference implementations using Altinn Authentication functionality

The SystemUser API reference implementation demonstrates how a service owner can use Altinn Authorization to authorize access to various resources in the resource registry.

- [LogisticsAPI](https://github.com/TheTechArch/altinn-systemuser/blob/main/src/SystemUserApi/SystemUserApi/Controllers/LogisticsController.cs) checks for read access to the resource **ttd\_systembruker-logistikk-demo**
- [SalaryAPI](https://github.com/TheTechArch/altinn-systemuser/blob/main/src/SystemUserApi/SystemUserApi/Controllers/SalaryController.cs) checks for read access to the resource **ttd\_systembruker-salary**

The SystemUser API uses Altinn PDP to authorize access for the system user. It retrieves information about the system user from the authenticated identity and uses that information to call Altinn authorization.

The project can be studied [here](https://github.com/TheTechArch/altinn-systemuser/tree/main/src/SystemUserApi/SystemUserApi).

Material UI is used in Altinn Studio as the React UI library. Material UI was chosen because

- It is based on the Google’s material design.
- It focuses exclusively on the React components
- Can use responsive components provided by the library
- Can override the style to customize the component to match the application requirements
- Can save time by using the components in the library instead of creating it from scratch (for example, the navigation drawers, application bar)
- It uses JSS as a styling solution that exposes a low-level API which helps in advanced overriding and theming mechanism

React router is a third party routing library used in Altinn Studio to trigger navigation within the application.

# Consent for Data Consumers

How to use the consent solution for data consumers in Altinn 3

## Introduction

This documentation describes how data consumers can request, retrieve, and manage consent using Altinn 3’s consent solution. Consent gives data consumers access to specific data resources for individuals or organizations, as defined by the API provider.

## Glossary

- **Data Consumer**: The organization requesting access to data about an individual or another organization.
- **Resource**: A category of data defined by the actor providing the API in Altinn (e.g., income information, tax base).

## Providers of Consent Solutions

Below are some key actors with consent solutions for Altinn 2. Most are expected to migrate to Altinn 3 during Q3 2025 or Q1 2026:

- **Skatteetaten (Norwegian Tax Administration)**
  - [About Consent](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/om/samtykke)
  - [Income API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/inntekt)
  - [Summed Tax Base API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/summertskattegrunnlag)
  - [Claims and Payments API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/kravogbetalinger)
  - [Employer’s National Insurance Contribution API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/arbeidsgiveravgift)
  - [VAT Reporting Information API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/mva_meldingsopplysning)
  - [Foreign Companies Assignments API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/oppdragutenlandskevirksomheter)
  - [Outstanding Claims API](https://skatteetaten.github.io/api-dokumentasjon/en/api/restanser)
- **Lånekassen (Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund)**
  - [Student Loan Balance](https://dokumentasjon.dsop.no/dsop_saldostudielan_om.html)

Altinn itself offers APIs for requesting consent and retrieving the status of consent requests.

## 1\. Request Consent

### 1.1 Prerequisites

1. The data consumer must have a registered Maskinporten client.
2. The data consumer must have been delegated the consent scope from Digdir.
3. The necessary scopes must be added to the Maskinporten client.
4. Access to request consent for the relevant resource(s) must be granted.

### 1.2 API Endpoint

- **Test**: `POST https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/accessmanagement/api/v1/enterprise/consentrequests/`
- **Production**: `POST https://platform.altinn.no/accessmanagement/api/v1/enterprise/consentrequests/`

#### Request (example)

}

```

## 2\. Retrieve Consent Token

In Altinn 3, the consent token is retrieved as part of the Maskinporten token. Specify the following in the JWT:

```jsonc
{
  "aud": "https://ver2.maskinporten.no/",
  "scope": "<scope>",
  "iss": "<client_id>",
  "exp": 1584693183,
  "iat": 1584693063,
  "jti": "<jti>",
  "type": "urn:altinn:consent",
  "id": "<consent_request_id>",
  "from": "urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:<pid>"
}

```

## 3\. Consent on Behalf of Others

To create consent requests on behalf of other organizations, the scope must be delegated:

1. The organization that will be the recipient delegates the necessary scope(s) in Altinn under API delegation.
2. The request is created as described above.
3. When retrieving the token, also specify `consumer_org`:

```jsonc
{
  "aud": "https://ver2.maskinporten.no/",
  "scope": "<scope>",
  "iss": "<client_id>",
  "exp": 1584693183,
  "iat": 1584693063,
  "jti": "<jti>",
  "type": "urn:altinn:consent",
  "id": "<consent_request_id>",
  "from": "urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:<pid>",
  "consumer_org": "<customer_orgnr>"
}

```

## Altinn CLI Configuration
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Configuration

A description of required configurations before using Altinn CLI.

# Configuration

The configuration of Altinn CLI is contained in `appsettings.json` in the repository.

It contains three sections:

1. Top level config
2. Maskinporten settings
3. InstantiationConfig

## Top level configurations

These configurations cover where to read and store data for the general commands,
as well as setting up base addresses for both Platform Storage and the app owner to interact with.

Below are the default values, further follows a description of each property.

```json hljs
{
  "StorageBaseAddress": "https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/storage/api/v1",
  "AppBaseAddress": "https://{org}.apps.tt02.altinn.no",
  "StorageOutputFolder": "c:/storage/Output",
  "StorageInputFolder": "c:/storage/Input",
  "CommandDefinitionFile": "C:/storage/CommandDefs/Commands.json"
}

```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| StorageBaseAddress | Base address for Platform Storage. Use domain `tt02.altinn.no` or `altinn.no` |
| AppBaseAddress | Base address for the app owner in Altinn. Use domain `tt02.altinn.no` or `altinn.no` |
| StorageOutputFolder | Folder where all output data should be stored. I.e. where to store downloaded instance data. |
| StorageInputFolder | Folder where all input data can be found. I.e. where all instance templates are available, |
| CommandDefinitionFile | Path for custom command definitions. If file exists, default commands will not be available. |

## Maskinporten settings

All clients interacting with an Altinn App and Altinn Platform must be authenticated using an Altinn Token.
In Altinn CLI, this is enabled by first authenticating through _Maskinporten_, and then converting the token.

Maskinporten settings cover the configuration for the registered client in Maskinporten,
as well as enabling an automatic exchange into an Altinn Token before sending a request.

[Read more about setting up a Maskinporten client with a custom key here.](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/solutions/cli/configuration/maskinporten-setup)

[A closer description of the config values is available here.](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-apiclient-maskinporten)

Your Maskinporten setting should look something like the example below.
Note that `ExchangeToAltinnToken` is set to `true`, and the scopes that are required. for interacting with an app or the platform.

```json hljs
  "MaskinportenSettings": {
    "Environment": "ver2",
    "ClientId": "e15abbbc-36ad-4300-abe9-021c9a245e20",
    "Scope": "altinn:serviceowner altinn:serviceowner/instances.read altinn:serviceowner/instances.write",
    "EncodedJwk": "eyJwIjoiMms2RlZMRW9iVVY0dmpjRjRCVWNLOUhasdfasdfarhgawfN2YXE5eE95a3NyS1Q345435S19oNV45645635423545t45t54wrgsdfgsfdgsfd444aefasdf5NzdFcWhGTGtaSVAzSmhZTlA0MEZOc1EifQ==",
    "ExhangeToAltinnToken": true
  }

```

## Instantiation configuration

The instantiation configuration is used by the batch command to identify folders to read/write from and to,
as well as to find the mappings for Altinn App entities such as applicationId and dataType.

Below is a description of each property in the config, further follows an example of an instantiation configuration.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| InputFolder | The folder where all batch files are available to be processed |
| OutputFolder | The folder where all processed batch files are moved to |
| ErrorFolder | The folder where the generated batch of all failed jobs is stored |
| ApplicationIdLookup | A dictionary for mapping _ExternalServiceCode_ to _ApplicationId_ |
| DataTypeLookup | A dictionary for mapping _DataFormatId_ to _dataType_ |

```json hljs
"InstantiationConfig": {
    "InputFolder": "C:/altinn-batch/input",
    "OutputFolder": "C:/altinn-batch/output/",
    "ErrorFolder": "C:/altinn-batch/error/",
    "ApplicationIdLookup": {
      "5681": "ttd/apps-test",
      "1337": "ttd/apps-test-prod",
    },
    "DataTypeLookup": {
      "6823": "default",

## Altinn 3 App API
What are you looking for?

# App API

The default APIs exposed by apps in Altinn 3

## Overview

The features documented here are the default features of any app created based on the app template in Altinn Studio. Application owners are free to make changes to this, but it is probably safe to say that removal of features will be extremely rare. Any app with changes to its API should have its own documentation published by the application owner.

All app API endpoints have the same URL base path that will vary based on application owner and application name. This is called `{basePath}` throughout the documentation.

**Test environment (TT02)**

```http hljs
https://{org}.apps.tt02.altinn.no/{org}/{appname}

```

**Production**

```http hljs
https://{org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}/{appname}

```

The URL identifies the application owner specific hostname using the short name ( **org**), and the identifier of the app consisting of both the application owner short name and the name of the app ( **org/appname**).

## Altinn Notifications Overview
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# What do you get?

Service owners and internal Altinn systems can send customized notifications to individuals in a personal or professional capacity through roles they hold within an organization. The recipient's name and contact details do not need to be known upfront, as the Altinn Notifications API can retrieve this information from national registries using the national identity number or organization number.

## Main Benefits

**Altinn Notifications** provides a robust and reliable service for communicating with end users across multiple channels. Key benefits include:

1. **Name Lookup**: Retrieve current names from national registries.
2. **Contact Details Lookup**: Retrieve current contact information from national registries.
3. **Authorization-Based Recipient Identification**: Use Altinn authorization to identify the correct recipients within an organization.
4. **Conditional Notifications**: Enable notifications that depend on the result of a condition check. NOTE: Notifications will request condition result from external system.
5. **API Access**: Programmatically send notifications and monitor their delivery status via the Altinn Notifications API.

## Notification Channels

Altinn Notifications supports the following communication channels:

- **Email**: Sends customized and formatted emails directly to users’ inboxes.
- **SMS**: Delivers customized, concise, timely messages to users’ mobile phones, supporting both national and international numbers.
- **EmailPreferred**: Prioritizes email as the primary channel, with SMS as a fallback when email contact information is unavailable.
- **SmsPreferred**: Prioritizes SMS as the primary channel, with email as a fallback when SMS contact information is unavailable.

### Future Improvements

Altinn plans to expand its notification channels to include a broader range of communication platforms, offering even greater flexibility and convenience for organizations and users.

## SMS Notifications

Altinn SMS notifications ensure the timely delivery of concise messages to users’ mobile phones. Below are the key details:

### Send Window

- SMS notifications are sent daily between **9 AM and 5 PM (Norway time)**.
- Notifications scheduled outside this timeframe are sent at **9 AM the following day**.
- Notification orders can be placed at any time.

### Supported Recipient Numbers

- **Format**: Mobile numbers must include the country code, preferably with a “+” or “00” (e.g., +47900XXXXX, 0047900XXXXX).
- **Restrictions**: SMS notifications to 5-digit numbers are not supported.
- **Norwegian Numbers**: Must begin with “4” or “9” after the country code “+47.”
  - Valid: +47400XXXXX, +47900XXXXX, 0047400XXXXX, 0047900XXXXX.
  - Invalid: +47500XXXXX, +47600XXXXX, 0047500XXXXX, 0047600XXXXX.
- **International Numbers**: Supported, as long as they include a valid country code.

## Email Notifications

Altinn Email notifications provide the capability to send plain text or HTML content directly to users’ inboxes.

### Content Types

- **Supported Formats**: Both plain text and HTML formats are supported.

### Recipient Restrictions

- **Single Recipient**: Each email notification is sent to one recipient.
- **Attachments**: Currently, email notifications do not support attachments.

## Recipient Lookup

Altinn offers recipient lookup functionality to determine names, contact details, and reservation status using a national identity number or organization number.

- **Timing**: Lookup occurs during order placement and again at the scheduled send time.
- **Responsibility**: It is the sender’s responsibility to check the send status. Lookup results are provided in the order response and detailed in the finished notifications.

[Learn more about recipient lookup in the explanation documentation.](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/notifications/explanation/recipient-lookup)

## Send Condition

The send condition feature ensures notifications are sent only when specific criteria are met. These conditions can be evaluated immediately or scheduled for future evaluation.

- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios like reminders, where a notification is sent only if a required action has not been completed.
- **Evaluation**: Conditions are checked by the application using the condition endpoint provided in the notification order.

## Altinn Events Overview
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Aug 18, 2025

# Events

Description of the Events capabilities in Altinn 3.

## Design goals

Altinn Events was developed to make it easier for service developers to deliver dynamic and
seamless user experiences, based on data from multiple systems.

Altinn Events provides developers a simple route to adding event-driven architecture to their existing
service-oriented applications. Secure and scalable, Altinn Events uses Publish/Subscribe concepts to
loosely couple disparate systems without relying on polling or database replication.

## Main benefits

Reasons to consider using Altinn Events

_For event publishers_

1. Simple HTTP interface to publish events to, as they occur.
2. Security, scalability, reliability and auditing built-in.
3. Altinn authorization services available for managing access to events for subscribers.

_For event subscribers_

1. No need to continuously poll for updates.
2. Simple API for creating and managing event subscriptions, including support for attribute-based filtering.
3. Reliable delivery with automatic retry logic means events will be buffered for you in case your webhook is unavailable for a period of time.
4. Built-in authorization policy execution ensures that your app won’t receive irrelevant notifications.

#### _Pub/Sub vs Event streaming_

There are two main event driven architecture models:
[Pub/Sub and Event streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven)

Altinn Events is based on the Pub/Sub model which has simpler delivery constraints than event streaming.
In particular, Altinn Events does not guarantee in-order delivery, nor exactly once delivery.

Consequentially, developers should make every effort to process events idempotently and
anticipate the possibility of out-of-order message delivery.

## Limitations

Intermittently, Altinn Apps using the opt-in events feature may fail to produce events as expected.
There are mitigating measures in place, and events affected by this issue may experience a delay of several hours.
See the above on pub/sub about out-of-order deliveries. Work is in progress to address this/reduce the delay.

#### Events are not guaranteed to be delivered.

Push-events have a fixed schedule for delivery-attempts and backoff-timings, before entering a “dead letter” state (see [retry-schedule](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/events/subscribe-to-events/#retry-schedule)).

Events expire after 90 days regardless of delivery status (see [publish events](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/events/publish-events/)).

## Terminology

#### What is an event?

An event is a lightweight notification message containing information about a single operation
or state change for a specified entity. Each event is published by a single originator, referred to
as the _event publisher_ or _source_, on behalf of a single person, organization or asset, known as the _subject_.
The operation or state change is referred to as the _event type_.

Technically, events are JSON documents conforming to the
[Cloud Event v1.0.2](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md) specification.
This specification defines a standard set of property names, accepted value formats and
a mechanism for encapsulating additional message payload, such as XML or binary encoded data.

Here is an example of a typical event:

```json hljs
{
    "id":"eae8d8a7-4659-43c0-83cd-42f673eff8cf",
    "source":"https://someservice.com/rest/path/object-id-1234",
    "specversion":"1.0",
    "type":"app.instance.created",
    "subject":"/party/50019855",
    "time": "2022-05-12T00:02:07.541482Z"
}

```

Here is an example of an event publish through Altinn:

```json hljs
{
    "id":"eae8d8a7-4659-43c0-83cd-42f673eff8cf",
    "source":"https://someservice.com/rest/path/object-id-1234",
    "specversion":"1.0",
    "type":"app.instance.created",
    "resource":"urn:altinn:resource:someservice.resource",
    "resourceinstance":"object-id-1234",
    "subject":"/party/50019855",
    "time": "2022-05-12T00:02:07.541482Z"
}

```

Note the new properties _resource_ and _resourceinstance_.

In addition to adhering to the specification, cloud events published through Altinn Events must include
a set of Altinn specific extension attributes used to enable authorization of events
and support easier filtering of events for subscribers.

#### What is a subscription?

Altinn Events allows you to register a custom webhook for receiving events.
You can define various filters, including by source, type and resource.

> For security reasons, the webhook endpoint must support HTTPS.

Before enabling event forwarding for a new subscription, Altinn Events sends a custom event to the provided webhook URL to ensure that it exists.

For more information, please see this [developer guide](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/events/subscribe-to-events/developer-guides/setup-subscription/)

## A note about standards

#### Why Cloud Events?

Basing our API on the Cloud Event standard ensures consistent support across [programming languages](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec#sdks), operating systems and network stacks.
This same standard has been adopted by many cloud providers and a growing number of independent solution providers.

The official specification defines a scaleable approach to versioning and extensions, opening possibilities for future capabilities in a backwards compatible fashion.

## Who can use Altinn Events?

Publishing of _app_ events is limited to Altinn apps created and deployed with altinn.studio. Generic, or non-app events can be published by an application owner system. The event produsing system must be registered as a resource in the resource registry.

Subscribing to events is openly available to end users, end user systems and application owners.
Once additional parties gain access to publishing, the right to subscribe to events published through Altinn
will be generally available to the public.\*

Subscriptions will need to be authorized by the publisher, and Altinn’s terms and conditions will have to be
signed before gaining access.

## BPMN 2.0 Modeling Guide
What are you looking for?

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# BPMN

Business Process Model and Notation.

[BPMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation) is a standard for business process modeling that provides a graphical notation
for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram, based on a flowcharting technique very similar to activity diagrams
from Unified Modeling Language (UML).

- BPMN 2.0 has a standardized XML format for exchanging BPMN 2.0 processes between different parties and software.
- BPMN 2.0 supports defining collaboartion between two or more collaborators.

## BPMN 2.0 XML Extensibility

In the formal specifications chapter 8.2.3 the following is described:

> The BPMN metamodel is aimed to be extensible. This allows BPMN adopters to extend the specified metamodel in a
> way that allows them to be still BPMN-compliant.
>
> It provides a set of extension elements, which allows BPMN adopters to attach additional attributes and elements to
> standard and existing BPMN elements.
>
> This approach results in more interchangeable models, because the standard elements are still intact and can still be
> understood by other BPMN adopters. It’s only the additional attributes and elements that MAY be lost during interchange.

**When extended the BPMN XML is still understood by other BPMN adopters,**
**but the additional attributes and elements MAY be lost during interchange.**

- Testing different BPMN software packages shows that the extended attributes in the XML does not show up as configurable properties in other software.
- Modifying the “default template” in the [BeeBPMN editor](https://www.beepmn.com/) did not remove the default Altinn properties.

## Altinn Access Control Architecture
What are you looking for?

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Application construction components - Altinn Access Control

The Access Control component in the Altinn platform is an asp.net core 6 web API application deployed as a docker container to the Altinn Platform Kubernetes cluster.

See [solutions](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/) for details about the functionality provided by this component.

[![Access Management](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/reference/architecture/accesscontrol/accesscontrol.drawio.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/reference/architecture/accesscontrol/accesscontrol.drawio.svg) _Construction Components Altinn Access Control_

The diagram below shows where the different solution components are located

The Authorization component is constructed as a asp.net MVC application exposing API. The API communicates with the different solution components

The below diagram shows the data flow including PEP.

[![Data flow authorization](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/reference/architecture/accesscontrol/data_flow_authorization.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/reference/architecture/accesscontrol/data_flow_authorization.svg) _Data flow authorization_

## Decision API

The decision API is the API that orchestrates the decision process.

The API supports both XACML XML and XACML Json Profile request.

See [Decision Controller](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Controllers/DecisionController.cs) for code details

### Policy Decision Point - PDP

This is implemented as a separate class [library](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/tree/main/src/Altinn.Authorization.ABAC) [This is published to Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Altinn.Authorization.ABAC/).

This library contains all models defined for XAMCL XML/JSON and utility methods to handle XACML documents.

The Policy Decision Point is implemented in this [class](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Altinn.Authorization.ABAC/PolicyDecisionPoint.cs).

It expects both decision request and policy to be inputed.

### Policy Retrieval Point - PRP

Policy Retrieval Point component that stores authorization policies for applications.

The policies are stored as XACML (xml) documents in a blob storage.

When an authorization request is received to PDP, PRP identifies the correct policy document in the policy storage.

[See code](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Services/Implementation/PolicyRetrievalPoint.cs).

PRP is configured as a service in the Authorization Component and can easily be replaced with other implementation.

### Context Handler

Context handler enriches the authorization request with information about the user and the resource requested.
Roles are retrieved from SBL Brigde while resource information is retrieved from Instances in storage.

[See code](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Services/Implementation/ContextHandler.cs).

Context Handler is configured as a service in Authorization Component and can easily be replaced with other implementation.

### Policy Information Point - Roles

PIP for roles, calls SBL bridge to get the rules a user or system has for a resource party.

This is implemented as a service. [See implementation](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Services/Implementation/RolesWrapper.cs)

This can easily be replaced with other implementation.

### Policy Information Point - Party

This is implemented as a service. [See implementation](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Services/Implementation/PartiesWrapper.cs)

This can easily be replaced with other implementation.

### Policy Information Point - Resources

PIP for resoruces checks storage for instance information.

This is implemented as a service. [See implementation](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Repositories/InstanceMetadataRepository.cs)

This can easily be replaced with other implementation.

## Api controllers

- [Decision](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Controllers/DecisionController.cs)
- [Policy](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Controllers/PolicyController.cs) (will be moved to resource registry)
- [Roles](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Controllers/RolesController.cs) (will be moved to access management)
- [Parties](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Controllers/PartiesController.cs) (will be moved to access management)

## Dependencies

See [csproj](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization/blob/main/src/Authorization/Altinn.Platform.Authorization.csproj).

## How to use Altinn Platform Authorization in your setup

The PDP does not contain any Altinn specific functionality. What you need to implement in your setup is

### Context Handler

You would need to write your own context handler functionality that undestand your domain. Meaning it would need to understand what
kind of enrichment that is needed. It the simplest scenarious this does not need to do anything if the authorization request contains all
information needed by PDP

### PRP

You need to implement funcionality to identify the correct XACML Policy. In Altinn we have different policies for the different apps, but in
some simple scenarios you would only need to reference a static XACML Policy.

### PIP

If context handler need to enrich

## Maskinporten Client Setup
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Setting up Maskinporten client

This page describes the process of setting up a Maskinporten client

To use the Altinn API, several scenarios require a Maskinporten client:

- Calling the Altinn API as an organization
- Authenticating as an enterprise user
- Authenticating as a system user

## Setting up the Maskinporten Client

Maskinporten clients are created in the self-service portal:

- For the production environment, clients are created from: [https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no](https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no/).
- For the test environment, clients are created from: [https://sjolvbetjening.test.samarbeid.digdir.no](https://sjolvbetjening.test.samarbeid.digdir.no/).

1. Start by logging into your account with your chosen method.
2. When logged into your account, the organisation you represent is shown in the top menu to the right.[![The organisation you represent is shown in the top menu](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/you_represent.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/you_represent.en.png) _The organisation you represent is shown in the top menu._If you logged in to represent a synthetic organisation, you will also be able to change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu on that item.[![You can change synthetic organisation in the drop down menu](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/change_synthetic_org.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/change_synthetic_org.en.png) _You can change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu._
3. Select the `Create client` button to start creating a new client for the organisation you represent.
4. On the `Add client` page select Maskinporten.
5. On the `Add Maskinporten client` page fill in the display name, description and add your required scopes (these values can also be changed later). Then click the `Create` button.[![The add Maskinporten client page](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/add_maskinporten_client_page.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/add_maskinporten_client_page.en.png) _The 'Add Maskinporten client' page._
6. You have now created a Maskinporten client for your organisation.
To use this client you need to add at least one authentication key. The client supports JWK and PEM keys.
Start by either locating an existing key or creating a new one. You can use the [Altinn JWKS tool](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-utils/tree/main/src/Altinn.Cli) or other key generator of your choice for this.
Next, navigate to the key section on your client page and select `Add`.[![Select the key section on your client page](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/key_section.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/key_section.en.png) _Keys can be added in the key section._In the `JWK or PEM format` field paste your public key and click `Save`. The key is now added to the client.
Store your private key from your JWK or PEM in a secure location, as it is used to authorize the use of this client.
If you use Azure Key Vault to store your private keys, they need to be base64-encoded before uploading.[![Paste your public key here](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/paste_public_key.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/paste_public_key.en.png) _The JWK or PEM public key is pasted in this field_
7. If you didn’t do so in step 5, you need to add the desired scopes to your client before it can be used.[![Adding scopes to the client](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/add_scopes1.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/add_scopes1.en.png) _From the Scopes tab on your client definition, click the Add button._[![Adding scopes to the client](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/add_scopes2.en.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/shared/maskinporten/add_scopes2.en.png) _Scopes available to your organisation will be shown in the list. Select the required ones and click Submit._

## Scope list

Depending on your usage, you will need to add the relevant scopes to your client. In the table below you will find a collection of commonly used scopes:

| Scope | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| altinn:instances.read | Altinn Apps API read |  |
| altinn:instances.write | Altinn Apps API write |  |
| altinn:authentication/systemregister | Access to system register | For system providers that need to manage systems available in system register |
| altinn:authorization/authorize | Access to PDP endpoint | For orgs that need to authorize access |

For a list of legacy scopes, please refer to [the Altinn 2 docs](https://altinn.github.io/docs/api/rest/kom-i-gang/scopes/).

## Authentication

A detailed description on how to authenticate your client with a JWT Grant is described [here](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_guide_apikonsument).

In the context of an [Altinn Studio](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio) app, integration with Maskinporten is available using the built-in authentication client. Simply follow along with the [user guide](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/guides/integration/maskinporten/) to get started.

For other _.Net_ apps, you can use this [standalone library](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-apiclient-maskinporten) to handle authentication. The library provides extension methods to configure HttpClients to authenticate with Maskinporten based on your provided configuration.

## Altinn System User Integration
What are you looking for?

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# System User

A large part of the communication between the public sector and businesses happens via APIs in Altinn and other platform providers in the public sector.

Approximately 50% of form traffic comes via API, with some services having almost 100% from business systems.

New authentication and authorization mechanisms are now being developed for machine-to-machine integration on the Altinn platform and other public APIs.

## Features of System User

System user offers several advantages compared to the enterprise user and end-user system concept in Altinn 2.

- An option for acquiring end-user systems without exchanging certificates/passwords.
- Easy onboarding of customers for system providers.
- Fine-grained authorization with machine-to-machine.
- Overview of system user accesses.
- System providers can share client setups across their customers (no need for multiple certificates).
- Will support client relationships with accountants/auditors from Q1 2025.
- Will be supported by Altinn Apps Q1 2025.

## Maskinporten and System User Token

Maskinporten is central to this new concept. Anyone who wants to use APIs with a system user must authenticate against Maskinporten to receive a system user token.

### Differences from Regular Maskinporten Tokens

System user token includes information about both the organization and the specific system user/system.

## Creation of System User

The system user is created by the actor who wants to use a business system for integration with Altinn or other public solutions. The system user is linked to the chosen system/system provider and assigned the necessary rights.

### Example

- **Organization:** Rørlegger Hansen & Sønner AS
- **System User:** “SmartCloud”
- **System:** “SmartCloud” from SmartCloud AS
- **Rights:** SmartCloud AS registers that “SmartCloud” needs rights to “VAT” and “Annual Accounts”.
- **Approval:** Hansen & Sønner AS accepts these rights upon the creation of the system user.

With this setup, SmartCloud AS can authenticate against Maskinporten and get a system user token for the system user of Rørlegger Hansen & Sønner AS. This token can be used against Altinn’s API or other services that support it. SmartCloud AS can thus process data for Rørlegger Hansen & Sønner AS within the assigned rights.

## Solution Description

![Concept](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/concept.drawio.svg)

### System Register

As part of the new concept, a system register is established in Altinn. The system register will contain an overview of systems offered by system providers.

System providers will have access to manage the systems they deliver in the register via API.

The register will contain the name and description of the system, in addition to the rights required for the system to function.

This information will help end-users grant the correct rights to system users that are created.

System providers will be able to use the information in the register to pre-fill information for provider-driven creation of system users.

As part of the system information, system providers must provide a clientID from Maskinporten to define which Maskinporten integrations should be able to authenticate as the system.

### Provider-Driven Creation of System User

An important feature of the new concept is to make it easier for system providers to guide their customers to the correct setup.

Today, this involves complex actions in the Altinn portal, followed by sharing passwords/certificates with the system provider. The new solution allows for significantly simplified onboarding of customers for system providers.

The system provider will be able to create a request for their customer to create a system user and assign the necessary rights. This can be compared to how one can consent to share income information with banks today.

The user is presented with a simplified GUI that describes that a system user/system integration will be created and that rights will be assigned. It will also describe which system/provider gets access to this system user.

In the example below, you can see how [SmartCloud](https://smartcloudaltinn.azurewebsites.net/) sends the user to Altinn during customer onboarding. Here, Per Olsen at “Rørlegger Olsen & Sønner AS” has registered as a user with SmartCloud.

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration4a.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration4a.png) _SmartCloud informs that system access must be set up in Altinn_

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration4.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration4.png) _Altinn presents a request from SmartCloud to create a system user_

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration4b.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration4b.png) _Upon confirmation, Altinn sends the user back to the desired page in SmartCloud_

The flow itself will vary from system to system.

In some cases, one can imagine that the system provider sends an email to the end-user with a link to confirmation, while in the future, one might also potentially see such requests from the Altinn workspace.

### Administration of System User

Organizations will be able to manage their system users from Altinn Profile.

They will be able to create system users and deactivate them.

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration1.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration1.png) _Administration of system users_

Users will be able to create new users and link them to systems/providers.

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration2.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration2.png) _Administration of system users_

The system provider must predefine which rights the system needs to be delegated to the system user.

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration3b.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration3b.png) _Creation of integration_

### System Users and Client Relationships

In many cases, an organization has an accountant or auditor who will report for the organization.

Support for this will come in delivery 5 of client delegation.

If we take the scenario above as a starting point, **Rørlegger Hansen & Sønner AS** has chosen **Fine Tall AS** as their accountant.
This is reported via coordinated register notification.

1. **Fine Tall AS** has created a system user for the system **SmartCloud** from SmartCloud AS.
2. The client administrator at Fine Tall AS delegates the access package “Accounting Responsible Payroll” for **Rørlegger Hansen & Sønner AS** to the system user that has been created.

In this way, **SmartCloud** can report for **Rørlegger Hansen & Sønner AS** with the system user for **Fine Tall AS**.

**Fine Tall AS** will be able to manage which of their customers should be handled by the system user. This administration can take place via GUI in Altinn or via their own API for client administration.

See more details in [Issue for Delivery 5](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authentication/issues/548).

## Technical Flow Authentication/Authorization

The diagram below shows how a business system can authenticate when a system user is created and linked.

1. The end-user system calls Maskinporten with a JWT Grant where the customer and key/client information are specified.
2. Maskinporten verifies with Altinn that the customer has granted the system linked to the client access.
3. Upon confirmation, Maskinporten issues a token containing information about the system user and the owner of the system user.
4. This token can then be used in calls to APIs (in Altinn or outside Altinn).
5. The API can be authorized.

[![Illustration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration5.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/systemuser/illustration5.png) _Creation of integration_

## Altinn API Authentication Guide
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Jul 30, 2025

# Authentication

How to authenticate using the APIs.

## Authentication for application owners

Application owners should be authenticated with [Maskinporten](https://www.digdir.no/felleslosninger/maskinporten/869).

### API provisioning in Maskinporten

#### API-provider

To provide an API in Maskinporten Altinn has to do two operations.

1. As API-provider Altinn registers a scope in _Maskinporten_


```json hljs
POST /scopes
{
       "prefix": "altinn",
       "subscope": "instances/metadata.read",
       "description": "Clients can access metadata for all instances for all apps of the organisation"
}

```

2. As API-provider Altinn has to give access to its scope for a given organisation


```http hljs
PUT /scopes/access/889640782?scope=altinn:apps.read

```


Here we have given organisation 889640782 access to the scope `altinn:instances/metadata.read`.
The organisation must then create a client that uses the scope.

#### API-consumer

To access the Altinn API an organisation must create a client.

1. As API-consumer the organisation must create a client in _Maskinporten_ with scopes provided by Altinn:


```json hljs
POST /clients
{
       "client_name": "altinnOrgRead",
       "client_type": "CONFIDENTIAL",
       "description": "Client for accessing the my orgs app data",
       "scopes": [ "altinn:instances/metadata.read" ],
       "token_reference": "SELF_CONTAINED"
}

```


### Scopes

scope names must follow the following regexp:

```perl hljs
^([a-z0-9]+\/?)+[a-z0-9]+(\.[a-z0-9]+)?$?

```

It means that we cannot have `-` or `_` in scope names.

#### All instances scope

```js hljs javascript
altinn:serviceowner/instances.read
altinn:serviceowner/instances.write

```

This is the most general scope which can be given to an organisation by Altinn.
It means that the application owner can create a client that can access all instances of apps issued by that application owner.

Clients with _write_ scope will be able to instantiate applications through direct access to the app’s api, update metadata,
update process state, upload data, validate data, and change process of an instance.

Clients with _read_ token will only be allowed to read metadata, data and events information.

### Exchange of JWT token

Application owners register clients in Maskinporten and selects the scope they need.

A client is authenticated by _Maskinporten_ and are given a _Maskinporten JWT access token_.

This token has to be validated and replaced with an _Altinn JWT access token_ which should be used to access the apis.

#### Maskinporten JWT access token (input)

Client provides a self-contained access-token.

```http hljs
Autorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJIdFlaMU1UbFZXUGNCV0JQVWV3TmxZd1RCRklicU1Hb081OFJ4bmN6TWJNIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJ0ZXN0X3JwIiwic2NvcGUiOiJ ...
GET /authentication/api/v1/exchange/maskinporten

```

The token looks something like this (after base64-decoding):

```json hljs
{
  "kid": "HtYZ1MTlVWPcBWBPUewNlYwTBFIbqMGoO58RxnczMbM",
  "alg": "RS256"
}
.
{
  "aud": "https://tt02.altinn.no/maskinporten-api/",
  "scope": "altinn:instances.write",
  "iss": "https://oidc-ver2.difi.no/idporten-oidc-provider/",
  "client_amr": "virksomhetssertifikat",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "exp": 1571935870,
  "iat": 1571923870,
  "client_id": "0de19f7a-f5fa-45d1-874c-3d2e88ce97d9",
  "client_orgno": "974760673",
  "jti": "U3HMLIY8b_X454CADQzfttSuWpCADPQhc57iZXVF_Ac",
  "consumer": {
    "authority": "iso6523-actorid-upis",
    "ID": "0192:974760673"
  }
}
.
<<signature>>

```

Maksinporten provides the legal `consumer` (the client) in ISO 6523 format. The `client_orgno` claim is deprecated.

#### The Altinn JWT Access token (output)

The convert operation validates the incoming token and generates a new JWT token with the same scope as the token.
The scopes is copied. The `orgNumber` and `org` is added by the token converter.

```json hljs
{
  "scope": "altinn:instances.read altinn:instances.write",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "exp": 1571996946,
  "iat": 1571995146,
  "client_id": "0de19f7a-f5fa-45d1-874c-3d2e88ce97d9",
  "client_orgno": "974760673",
  "jti": "BcNIAuZKXdjpECmmwalAm-pcBp0iNc56T6eXhlxNBZE",
  "consumer": {
    "authority": "iso6523-actorid-upis",
    "ID": "0192:974760673"
  },
  "org": "brg",
  "orgNumber": 974760673,
  "iss": "https://platform.altinn.cloud/",
  "AuthenticateMethod": "maskinporten",
  "AuthenticationLevel": 3,
  "nbf": 1571995146
}
.
<<signature>>

```

## Authentication for end user system

End user systems should be authentication with [ID-porten](https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/idporten_overordnet.html).
When authenticated the system may exchange an access token provided by ID-porten with an Altinn token by instructions below.

#### Exchange of JWT token

This token has to be validated and replaced with an _Altinn JWT access token_ which should be used to access the apis.

##### ID-porten JWT access token (input)

```http hljs
Autorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJjWmswME1rbTVIQzRnN3Z0NmNwUDVGSFpMS0pzdzhmQkFJdUZiUzRSVEQ0IiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.eyJhdF9 ...
GET /authentication/api/v1/exchange/id-porten

```

The token looks something like this (after decoding):

```json hljs
{
  "kid": "cZk00Mkm5HC4g7vt6cpP5FHZLKJsw8fBAIuFbS4RTD4",
  "alg": "RS256"

  "jti": "_Og8JT1zMKzzHFB4WoVCdvqzmEpoY1hPhLa47bieJ94"
}
.
<<signature>>

```

##### The Altinn JWT Access token (output)

The exchange operation validates the incoming token and generates a new JWT token that contains user data
retrieved from the database using the provided pid (person identification number) and pre-existing data from the ID-porten token.

`pid` is referred to as ssn (social security number) i Altinn Platform.

```json hljs
{
  "nameid": "20000011",
  "urn:altinn:userid": "20000011",
  "urn:altinn:username": "",
  "urn:altinn:partyid": 50002119,
  "urn:altinn:authenticatemethod": "Minid-PIN",
  "urn:altinn:authlevel": 3,
  "amr": "Minid-PIN",

## Open ID Connect configuration

This is work-in-progress. The response is still missing required information and might be inconsistent with actual authentication mechanisms.

Metadata about Altinn as an Open ID provider is exposed as a .well-known endpoint as defined
by [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig).

The primary purpose of this endpoint is to make available the Altinn signing certificate for the JSON Web Tokens being generated.
It is recommended that clients of Altinn use this discovery endpoint to automatically have their systems updated when Altinn changes their signing certificate.

## React Redux Architecture Guidelines
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Kodearkitektur

Kodearkitektur for React og tilhørende teknologi

## Bruk av Redux Store i Containere og Components.

### Kort oppsummert (TL;DR)

Send “ID” eller andre identifikatorer via Props til komponenten og la komponenten hente data fra Redux Store.

### Utfordring (Why?)

Hvis en del av Redux Store sendes som Props så vil komponenten re-rendres ved endringer av denne Prop/Store. Det er ønskelig at komponenter ikke rendrer unødvendig.

### Re-rendring trigges av…

- Endring av Props.
- Endring av State som endrer Props.

#### Kilder

- [Redux best practices](https://medium.com/lexical-labs-engineering/redux-best-practices-64d59775802e)
- [Common pitfalls](https://itnext.io/redux-ruins-you-react-app-performance-you-are-doing-something-wrong-82e28ec96cf5)

## Filtrering av Redux Store i mapStateToProps() ved help av Selector

### Kort oppsummert (TL;DR)

Bruk Memoized Selector for å filtrere Redux Store til Props når Redux Store er stor.

### Utfordring (Why?)

Hver gang (en del av) Redux Store endrer seg vil funksjoner som filtrerer ut deler av Redux Store kjøres. Hvis Redux Store (state tree) er stor (mange endringer) eller funksjonen er krevende kan det føre til ytelsesproblemer.

### Løsningen

En Selector funksjon, med bruk av “reduxjs/reselect” vil kun kjøres når en definert del av Redux Store endres (eks “state.del.underdel”).

#### Kilder

- [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
- [Comparing shouldComponentUpdate() and Reselect](https://blog.rangle.io/react-and-redux-performance-with-reselect/)

### Eksempel

#### Selector

Dette er en enkel Selector uten mye logikk og filtrering. Jo større logikk i “filtreringen” jo mer “sparer” man i ytelse.

```javascript hljs
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

/**
 * Reselect version
 */
const formDataSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) => {
  console.log('formdata selector', providedProps.id);
  return state.formFiller.formData;
};

const dataModelBindingSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) => {
  console.log('datamodelBindingSelector');
  return state.formDesigner.layout.components[providedProps.id].dataModelBinding;
};

const getFormData = () => {
  console.log('getFormData() is trigggered, selector is created');

      console.log('ouput selector running', formData);

      if (!formData[dataModelBinding]) return '';
      return formData[dataModelBinding];
    },
  );
};

export const makeGetFormDataSelector = getFormData;

// Alternativt en enda enklere variant, som er implementert p.t.

import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const formDataSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) => {
  return state.formFiller.formData[state.formDesigner.layout.components[providedProps.id].dataModelBinding];

    (formData: any) => {
      if (!formData) return '';
      return formData;
    },
  );
};

export const makeGetFormDataSelector = getFormData;

```

#### Implementasjon i mapStateToProps

```javascript hljs
const makeMapStateToProps = () => {
  const GetFormDataSelector = makeGetFormDataSelector();
  const mapStateToProps = (state: IAppState, props: IProvidedProps): IFormElementProps => ({
    id: props.id,
    formData: GetFormDataSelector(state, props),
  });
  return mapStateToProps;
};

export const FormComponentWrapper = connect(makeMapStateToProps)(FormComponent);

```

makeMapStateToProps implementeres slik at Selectoren kan gjenbrukes på tvers av flere komponenter.

## Higher-Order Components

Higher-Order component er en funksjon som tar imot en component og returnerer et nytt komponent med ekstra funksjoner, eller ekstra data.
Et eksempel på dette er _connect_-funksjonen fra “redux”, som tar imot en funksjon som velger redux-state data, og en komponent som disse dataene skal sendes til.

### Hvorfor?

Ved å wrappe induviduelle komponenter i en higher-order component, vil vi få enklere kode mtp. at en funksjon håndterer endringer i skjemaet på kun en komponent, i motsetning til å ha en funksjon som håndterer alle endringer i skjemaet.
Dette vil også gi tredjeparts-utviklere en enklere måte å skrive egne funksjoner for håndtering av endringer i deres komponenter.

#### Eksempel på bruk i Altinn Studio

Når bruker lager en tjeneste med 3. parts komponenter vil vi wrappe disse komponentene i en
Higher Order Component som gir den en callback funksjon som tar imot data som komponenten har,
og kjøre en redux-action som oppdaterer data i redux-state. Uten at utvikleren av 3. parts komponenten må sette seg inn i hvilke actions som skal kjøres.
Dette gir også bedre mulighet for å gjennbruke 3. parts komponenter.

#### Eksempel på Higher Order Component

```javascript hljs
const FormComponentWrapper = (WrappedComponent, ...) => {
	// Feel free to do anything that will enhance the components properties

	// Return a react component
	return class extends React.Component {
		// Add functions for handling changing of data
		handleDataChange = (dataModelBinding, data) => {
			// fire off an action for adding the changed data to redux state
		}

		render() {
			return(
				<WrappedComponent onFormDataChange={this.handleDataChange} {...props}/>
			);
		}
	}
}

```

## Normalized Redux Store

### Kort oppsummert (TL;DR)

- Hver datatype får sin egen “tabell” i State.
- Hver “tabell” skal lagre individuelle “data” som objekter, med IDer som nøkler og “dataen” som verdi.
- Referansene til de individuelle “dataene” lagres ved å lagre IDene.
- Array med IDene brukes for å indikere sortering.

### Utfordring (Why?)

- Kompliserte reducers for å oppdatere nøstet state struktur.
- Unødvendig re-rendering grunnet oppdatering av nøstede objekter.

### Eksempel

```javascript hljs
{
    posts : {
        byId : {
            "post1" : {
                id : "post1",

# What do you get?

Overview of components and functions provided by Altinn Authorization.

Altinn Authorization provides components and services that can be used by public entities, system providers/end-user systems, businesses, and individuals to perform access management and access control for services both on and outside the Altinn platform, as well as from their own end-user systems.

**Service owners** can register resources in the Resource Register for services that require access management. In the Resource Register, rules can be created specifying who can use a service, for what purpose, and under which conditions. If a service should only be available to a specific group of organizations, this can be managed through access lists.
With the authorization service (PDP), the resource owner can ensure access control over the resource. This access control supports users from both ID-porten and Maskinporten.

**System-vendors** can use our APIs to authenticate their users against public services.

**End-user** can act on behalf of an organization or themselves. In the Altinn portal or via an end-user system, the user can select whom they are acting on behalf of. The end user can view which authorizations exist and who has authorization on their behalf. Authorizations can be granted or revoked via both the user interface and API.

Authentication Altinn Authorization provides authentication functionality using ID-porten and Maskinporten against Altinn. In addition, we offer System User functionality, which enables fine-grained access management through Maskinporten.

## Altinn Studio Prefill

# Prefill

What is prefilling of data?

Prefilling data allows you to provide the end user with a form where relevant fields are already populated with
available data.
An example of this concept is the Norwegian tax returns. Each year an individuals tax return is prefilled with
all the details the Norwegian Tax Administration already have about the individual. The user can then review the
information and either confirm or make necessary changes.

In Altinn Studio there are several ways to prefill a form.

- To show data from the National Population Register (DSF), the Central Coordinating Register (ER) or the users profile
in Altinn, you can set up prefill via static configuration files.
- Data that is available via external API’s can be fetched during startup of a new instance of an app, and added
to the form via backend code.
- An app can be started directly via API’s, and it is then possible to include (complete or partial) form data as part
of the request.

## Altinn Correspondence Migration
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Oct 23, 2025

# Migration of Correspondence Data

Migration of Correspondence Data for Altinn Correspondence

The “Flytt av Data” project will take responsibility for migrating all historical correspondences and attachments to the new solution.

- An automated job migrates correspondences and associated attachments from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 using a dedicated API endpoint.
- The migrated version of an element will have a reference to its old Altinn 2 version, exposed in the field: “Altinn2CorrespondenceId” in the CorrespondenceOverview endpoint.
- After migration, the elements will still be available in Altinn 2, both in the Portal and via API.
- After migration, changes to the element will be synchronized both ways, between the Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 versions of the element.
- The Altinn 3 version of the migrated element will, once migration is complete, have an “IsMigrating” flag that keeps it hidden from regular API calls.
- When the flag “IsMigrating” is removed, the migrated message will become available in the same manner as other Altinn 3 Correspondences.
  - Altinn 3 Correspondence API.
  - Can be created in Dialogporten and thus accessed in Arbeidsflate.
  - The Altinn 3 version of the message will **not** be available in Altinn 2 Portal, which will continue to show the Altinn 2 version of the message.
- No data is deleted as a result of migration; the correspondences are only flagged in the database, and it is possible to perform the migration again and/or manually retrieve data if needed.

The migration will take place over time, and can be configured to re-migrate messages.

## Volume and Migration Rate

It is estimated that over 500 million correspondences with attachments will be migrated from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3.
Therefore, it is planned to perform the migration gently, starting with smaller volumes over time to gather experience and avoid disrupting the environments.

Over time, the rate will increase and eventually be almost up to date with live traffic in Altinn 2 as it slowly decreases and Altinn 2 is phased out.

## Migration Criteria

The migration component will extract a certain number of elements per run for all services, sorted by the oldest message first.

## Detailed Migration Process per Element

The migration process per correspondence will be divided into several steps to reduce risk and can be controlled per correspondence, with the ability to delete data and restart the process.
No data is deleted from Altinn 2.

1. Migration of message data and attachments from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3, where we are not dependent on [service configuration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/correspondence/transition/service-migration/).
2. Migration of necessary [service configuration](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/correspondence/transition/service-migration/) and access rules.
3. Migration of associated instance and service delegations.
4. Creation of the migrated message in the Dialog Portal/Unified Workspace.

Initially, steps 1, 2, and 3 will be triggered manually as separate actions by the Move Data team, and step 4 will be triggered by the Dialog Portal/Unified Workspace.

Eventually, as full production for all components approaches, this will be handled automatically in a single process for new messages.

## What Data is Migrated?

- Only correspondences that have not been deleted. (added to “deleted items” or permanently deleted)
- No correspondences for dead people.
- Correspondence content, including text and all attachments and metadata.
- A limited form of notification history: Time and recipient address, but not text content.
- Change history; including opening, read confirmation, and information about forwarding and instance delegation.
- Altinn 2 CorrespondenceId and NotificationId, making it possible to look up in Altinn 2 in cases where more detailed investigations are needed.

## Synchronization of Status Changes between Altinn 2 and 3

There will be two-way synchronization of status changes and events on messages between Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 after migration is completed.

This solution will be referred to as “CorrespondenceSync”.

Existing status/history will be migrated in step 1 but will be continuously synchronized as changes occur.

Because there are some differences and technical limitations, synchronization consists of the following events:

### Events synchronized both ways

- Opened / read
- Confirmed
- Permanent deletion

### Events synchronized only from Altinn 2 to 3

- Archiving
- Move to trash / remove from trash
- Notification sent
- Forwarding

## Technical Implementation

- A dedicated endpoint is created in Altinn 3 Correspondence that only provides access to the Migration component; [MigrationController](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-correspondence/blob/main/src/Altinn.Correspondence.API/Controllers/MigrationController.cs).
- An Altinn 2 AltinnBatch-based migration component “MigrateCorrespondence” is created
  - Consumes the migration endpoint.
  - Uses configuration in the Altinn 2 database to control migration.
  - Can be triggered manually with parameters, but will over time run more or less continuously.
- A synchronization job “AltinnCorrespondenceSync” is created to synchronize status events for messages from Altinn 2 to 3.
  - It calls dedicated sync endpoints in the Altinn 3 Correspondence API.
- In Altinn 3 Correspondence, the handlers for “Read”, “Confirmed” and “Purged” are extended
  - These call dedicated “Sync” endpoints in the Altinn 2 SBLBridge API.

## Altinn Authorization Overview

# About Authorization

The authorization components provide access management and control functionality for digital and analog services hosted in the Altinn Platform or other places.

Altinn Authorization offers a collection of components and services that public entities, system providers, businesses, and citizens can use to achieve this.

A common scenario is when a public entity wants to control who can have access to or modify data in a given service.
The public entity that owns this service is the resource owner. The service can be one running on the Altinn platform or on the resource owner’s own platform.

To use Altinn Authorization, the resource owner must register the service in the Resource Register. Here, information about the service is specified, and access rules/policies are set to control who can use the service.

[![Brukerscenario](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/about/om_autorisasjon.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/about/om_autorisasjon.svg) _Altinn Autoriasjon_

Businesses and private individuals can, through the Altinn Authorization user interface, grant authorization so that others can act on their behalf or on behalf of their business.
In the user interface, one can also see who holds such authorizations and, if necessary, revoke them.

To support scenarios where one works within a specialized system — for example, an accounting system — we also offer APIs so that system providers can offer authorization functionality through their systems.

# Authorization Attributes

Learn how dialogs in Dialogporten implements fine-grained access control using Altinn Authorization

## Introduction

Actions and other parts (e.g., references to transmissions) of the dialog can also specify an additional _authorization attribute_ .

This allows having different authorization requirements for the same type of action available in different dialog states. For example, it can be used to make a signing action available only to an external auditor/accountant, while another signing action is available to the CEO.

The access rules can be defined in the same policy as the dialog [service resource](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/authorization/service-resource/) (called a “sub resource”), or in its own separate service resource.

Authorization attributes can also be used on [transmissions](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/dialogs#transmissions) to define specific access rules controlling who is allowed to read a given transmission.

# StyleCop

Stylecop analyzer is a code analysis tool for C#.

StyleCop.Analyzers provides warnings that indicate style and consistency rule violations in C# code.
The warnings are organized into rule areas such as documentation, layout, naming, ordering, readability, spacing, and so forth.
Each warning signifies a violation of a style or consistency rule.

In Altinn Studio, we have turned set this “warning” action to “Error” to enforce the use of rules.

## Nuget Package

Instructions to install the stylecop analyzer in your project can be found [here](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers).

## Ruleset

A solution wide stylecop ruleset and configuration(stylecop.json) is set for altinn studio application.
This can be linked to the projects by linking these files like below in the project.
It is set to only work when building in Debug mode.

```xml hljs
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='Debug'">
  <PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers.Unstable" Version="1.1.1.61" />
  <AdditionalFiles Include="$(SolutionDir)stylecop.json">

  </AdditionalFiles>
</ItemGroup>

<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='Debug'">
  <CodeAnalysisRuleSet>$(SolutionDir)Altinn3.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
</PropertyGroup>

```

We have turn on the rules that will improve the code quality and maintainability.

## Turn off/Turn on a rule

To turn on/off a rule from the ruleset,

1. Click on Altinn3.ruleset file in the solution explorer
2. Expand the Stylecop.Analyzers
3. Check/uncheck the rule you want to turn on/off

## Altinn Service Migration Plan
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Oct 27, 2025

# Planer for migrering av tjenester i Altinn

Her finner du foreløpig plan for migrering av tjenester og når de enkelte tjenestetypene skal være flyttet fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3.

## Skjema-, innsyns- og samhandlingstjenester

### Migreringsstrategi

Innen juni 2026 må alle skjematjenester enten være flyttet fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3, avvikles eller implementeres på andre løsninger.

Tjenesteeier er selv ansvarlig for å migrere disse tjenestene fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3. Det innebærer at man må utvikle skjematjenesten på nytt som en 3.0 app. Her finner du veiledning for å komme i gang.

Tjenesteeier kan allerede nå begynne å flytte sine tjenester, men det er fortsatt noe funksjonalitet som finnes i Altinn 2 som vi ikke har støtte for i Altinn 3.0.

Plan for gjenstående funksjonalitet fra Altinn 2 og når denne leveres i Altinn 3:

- Betaling: Q2-2024
- Parallellsignering: Q3-2024
- Brukerstyrt signering: Q3-2024
- Samhandlingstjenester: Q2-2024
- Avanserte tjenester: TBA

Skulle du finne ting som mangler fra Altinn 2 og som er kritisk å få på plass så ta kontakt med oss på [servicedesk@digdir.no](mailto:servicedesk@digdir.no).

Vi har et åpent veikart for Altinn Studio hvor du også finner oversikt over annen større funksjonalitet som kommer utover det som er nevnt over.

Tidsplan

- Oppstart utvikling av løsning: Pågående
- Klart for migrering av tjenester: Se plan over
- Migrering tjenester avsluttet: 31. mai 2026 (tidligere migrering anbefales)

## Lenketjenester

### Migreringsstrategi

Det legges opp til at “Lenketjenester” kan flyttes èn og èn fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3.

Det er tjenesteeiers ansvar at disse flyttes, men Altinn vil legge til rette for at denne jobben blir så enkel som mulig. Alle tjenesteeier som dette gjelder vil bli kontaktet særskilt.

Lenketjenester bytter navn i forbindelse med flytting og tjenesten vil i Altinn 3.0 hete " Generelle autorisasjonsressurser".
Lenketjenester vil bli “resourcetype” av typen “GenericAccessResource”.

Alle delegeringer som finnes for disse tjenestene vil bli tatt vare på og flyttet samtidig med tjenesten fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3.
Det betyr at alle brukere som i dag har tilgang til en ekstern lenketjenester på vegne av en aktør vil beholde disse delegeringene etter at tjenestene er flyttet.

### Konsekvenser for tilhørende API

Det vil bli laget nye API for å hente ut informasjon om brukers rettigheter på vegne av andre.
Dette er API som i dag brukes av alle tjenesteeiere som har opprettet lenketjenster og som bruker Altinn som tilgangsstyringsløsning på deres egen tjensteplattform.

AutotorisasjonsAPI i Altinn 2 for tjenesteeier vil ikke inneholde informasjon om lenketjenester som er flyttet fra A2 til A3.
Tjenesteeiere kan derfor ikke flytte sine ressurser før de er klar til å ta i bruk nye API for autorisasjon i Altinn 3.
Beskrivelse av de nye APIene for tjenesteeiere finnes i [swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/jonkjetiloye/AccessManagementServiceOwnerAPI/1.0). Denne er fortsatt under arbeid.

Det vil i en overgangsfase være mulig for sluttbrukersystem å benytte de gamle API-ene på REST og SOAP.
Beskrivelse av de nye APIene for sluttbrukersystem finnes i [swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/jonkjetiloye/Accessmanagement/1.0.0#/). Denne er fortsatt under arbeid.

### Konsekvenser for Lokale roller i Altinn 2

Lokale roller fungerer i dag kun for tjenester som finnes på Altinn 2 plattformen. Vi har undersøkt utbredelse og bruk av disse og ser at funksjonaliteten er tatt i bruk av svært få virksomheter. I tillegg tror vi behovet for lokale roller vil forsvinne når man innfører [nye tilgangspakker](https://docs.altinn.studio/nb/authorization/what-do-you-get/accessgroups/type-accessgroups/) i Altinn 3.

Det er derfor tatt en beslutning om at man ikke vil videreføre lokale roller i Altinn 3, men at vi inntill videre lar de lokale rollene som er opprettet og i bruk bestå. I praksis betyr dette at etterhvert som flere og flere tjenester migreres fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 så vil de lokale roller ha færre og færre tjenester de gjelder for.

### Tidsplan

- Oppstart utvikling: 01.01.2023
- Klart for migrering av lenketjenester: Q2 2024
- Migrering må være gjort innen: 18. juni 2026 (tidligere migrering anbefales, support avsluttes 31. mai)

## Samtykketjenester

### Migreringsstrategi

Det er ikke bestemt om tjenester av typen “Samtykke” skal flyttes èn og èn fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 eller om det skal gjøres i èn operasjon.

Alle samtykker som finnes for disse tjenestene vil bli tatt vare på og flyttet samtidig med tjenesten fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3.
Det betyr at alle brukere som i dag har fått samtykke på vegne av en aktør vil beholde dette etter at tjenestene er flyttet.

### Konsekvenser for tilhørende API

Det er fortsatt ikke utredet hvilke konsekvenser dette får for API som tilhører samtykketjenester.

### Tidsplan

- Oppstart utvikling: Q2 2025
- Klart for migrering av samtykketjenester: Q3 2025
- Migrering må være gjort innen: 18. juni 2026 (tidligere migrering anbefales, support avsluttes 31. mai)

## Formidlingstjenester

### Migreringsstrategi

Det er ikke bestemt om alle tjenester av typen “Formidlingstjenester” skal flyttes èn og èn fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 eller om det skal gjøres i èn operasjon.

Konsept for modernisering av Formidlingstjenesten følges opp [her](https://github.com/digdir/portfolio/issues/48)

### Konsekvenser for tilhørende API

Det er fortsatt ikke utredet hvilke konsekvenser dette får for API som tilhører formidlingstjenesten.
Det vil i en overgangsfase være mulig å benytte de gamle API-ene.

### Tidsplan

- Oppstart utvikling: Q3 2023
- Klart for migrering av tjenester: Q2 2024
- Migrering av tjenester må være gjort innen: 31. mai 2026 (tidligere migrering anbefales)

## Meldingstjenester

### Migreringsstrategi

Det er ikke bestemt hvilken migreringsstrategi man skal ha for meldingstjenester (Correspondence),
Valgt løsning for [dialogporten](https://digdir.github.io/dialogporten/) vil henge sammen med migrering av meldingstjenester.
Fremdriftsplan for dialogporten finner du [her](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/8/views/25)

### Konsekvenser for tilhørende API

Det er ikke utredet hvilke konsekvenser dette har på tilhørende API

### Tidsplan

- Oppstart utvikling: Q1 2024
- Klart for migrering av tjenester: Q3 2024
- Migrering av tjenester må være gjort innen: 31. mai 2026 (tidligere migrering anbefales)

## Delegerbare API ressurser (ferdig migrert)

### Migreringsstrategi

Alle tjenester av typen “Delegerbare api ressurser” ble flyttet Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 i en operasjon 13.6.2023.

Alle delegeringer som eksisterte for disse tjenestene ble tatt vare på og flyttet samtidig med tjenesten fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3.
Det betyr at alle systemleverandører som før hadde rettighet til å bruke “Delegerbare API ressurser” på vegne av sine kunder vil beholdt disse delegeringene etter at tjenestene er flyttet.

Delegerbare API ressurser vil bli “resourcetype” av typen “MaskinportenSchema” i Altinn 3.

### Konsekvenser for tilhørende API

Etter at tjenestene er flyttet er det ikke lenger mulig for tjenesteeiere å opprette nye Delegerbare API ressurser via dagens grensesnitt.
Nye grensesnitt for dette vil bli gjort tilgjengelig i Altinn 3 i løpet av 2023
Tjenesteeiere som ønsker å opprette nye tjenester av typen “Delegerbare API ressurser” må inntill videre sende epost til [support@altinn.no](mailto:support@altinn.no) og be Digdir om å opprette/redigere disse på deres vegne.

Det er laget nye API for å hente ut informasjon om hvilke delegeringer som foreligger. Dette er API som i dag brukes av Maskinporten, Norsk Helsenett og SKatteetaten.
I en overgangsfase være mulig å benytte de gamle API-ene i Altinn 2. Dato for når vi slår av disse APIene i Altinn 2 er ikke bestemt

Informasjon om tjenestene vil etter flytting kunne slås opp her:

- [Testmiljø- tt02](https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/search)
- [Produksjonsmlijø - altinn.no](https://platform.altinn.no/resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/search)

#### API for delegering slås av

I dag er det mulig for sluttbrukere å benytte API for å slette eller opprette delegeringer til Delegerbare API-ressurser; se [API-beskrivelse](https://altinn.github.io/docs/api/rest/autorisasjon/roller-og-rettigheter/#slette-delegerte-tjenesterettigheter--roller). I forbindelse med migrering av disse ressursene fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 vil det i en overgangsfase ikke lenger være mulig å utføre dette via API. Nye API vil bli tilbys i løpet av Q4 2023.

### Tidsplan

- Oppstart utvikling: Avsluttet
- Migrering tjenester avsluttet: Alle tjenester ble flyttet 13.6.23
- Informasjon sendt til tjenesteeiere finner du [her](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/migration/informasjon-sent/letter-api-resources)

## Altinn System Register API
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# System register

API for the vendor to manage the system register

## System Register API

The system register api provides api methods for the vendor to manage the system. The system is maintained in the Altinn’s System Register.

## Security Scheme

Bearer authentication scheme is used to authenticate the system vendor.
System register api requires that the system vendor authenticates with a bearer token which is a Maskinporten token with specific scope.
To get a Maskinporten token, the vendor must first establish a client in Maskinporten. You can follow the [steps described here](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/getting-started/maskinportenclient/) to setup a Maskinporten client.

## API Methods

# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is used to manage the docker containers.

[![Kubernetes logo](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/kubernetes/kubernetes.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/kubernetes/kubernetes.png) _Kubernetes logo_

Kubernetes is described as container orchitrastion. That means how containers are run,
exposed and all other operations that might be done on a container.

Both Altinn Studio and Altinn Studio Apps consists of many different applications
running in docker containers. For the Altinn Studio Apps solution this could possible
over time be many thousands containers running different end user apps.

Kubernetes is used to manage the containers.

# React

Modulært rammeverk for å utvikle UI komponenter og SPA applikasjoner.

[![React logo](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/react/react-logo.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/react/react-logo.svg) _React logo_

- Modulært rammeverk for å utvikle UI komponenter som kan gjenbrukes flere steder i løsningen.
- Hvert React komponent har en tilstand som gir den data i henhold til hvor i applikasjonen brukeren er og hvilke handlinger som foretas.
- Vedlikeholdt av Facebook, under MIT lisens.

## Slik React blir brukt

### Uten redux

- Ved bruk av higher order components kan tilstand sendes fra rot-komponenten nedover i komponent-hierarkiet.
- Rot-komponenten håndterer alt av state, og sender callbacks ned i komponentene, slik at det er mulig og legge til, fjerne og endre komponenter.

[![Higher order component](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/react/higher-order-component.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/tools/react/higher-order-component.png) _Higher order component_

### Med redux

- Ved bruk av redux vil vi ikke være like avhengig av higher order components, da alle komponenter kan kobles til redux-state av appen,
og kunne håndtere det å legge til, fjerne eller endre komponenter selv.
- Håndtering av state skjer igjennom Actions og Reducers, som Redux arkitektur anbefaler.

## Altinn Architecture Patterns
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Architecture Patterns

The architecture defines some patterns that is reused accross the different solutions.

## Cloud Native

The solutions are designed and built to be [“Cloud Native”](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md), meaning
it is built be scalable applications hosted in public cloud.

There is serveral Architecture Patterns that Cloud Native applications are built on.

Containers, microservices and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled components that are resilient, manageable, and observable.

Combined with robust automation, they allow the devops team to make changes frequently.

The Cloud Native blueprint below show the important aspect of a Cloud Native solution.

[![Cloud Native blueprint](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/patterns/cloudnative.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/patterns/cloudnative.svg) _Cloud Native_

The following listing describes the different Architecture Patterns selected for Altinn.

## Microservice Pattern

### Overview

The [Microservice Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) is one of the more defining patterns in the platform.

In the new Altinn Solutions this mean that Altinn Platform will be grouped in functional related components, that will run as
separate applications in docker containers.

Example components are authorization and storage.

Each application created in Altinn Studio will be a isolated microservice application with API’s and front-end.

[![Conceptual View](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/patterns/microservices.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/patterns/microservices.svg) _Microservice Pattern Conceptual View_

### Benefits

- Strong Module Boundaries: Microservices reinforce modular structure, which is particularly important for larger teams.
- Independent Deployment: Simple services are easier to deploy, and since they are autonomous, are less likely to cause system failures when they go wrong.
- Technology Diversity: With microservices you can mix multiple languages, development frameworks and data-storage technologies.

### Risk & Issues

- Distribution: Distributed systems are harder to program, since remote calls are slow and are always at risk of failure.
- Eventual Consistency: Maintaining strong consistency is extremely difficult for a distributed system, which means everyone has to manage eventual consistency.
- Operational Complexity: You need a mature operations team to manage lots of services, which are being redeployed regularly.

## Layered Pattern

### Overview

Applications/Components are organized into horizontal layers, each layer performing a specific
role within the application. Typical the layers will typical be Presentation, API, Business and dataacess where dataccess could be access to database or
API calls to other components.

[![Conceptual View](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/patterns/layered.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/patterns/layered.svg) _Layered Pattern Conceptual View_

### Benefits

- Testability. Dependency injection. Possible to mock lower layers.

## Altinn Authorization API Migration
What are you looking for?

# Planer for modernisering og migrering av API i Altinn

Siden er under konstruksjon - Her finner du foreløpig plan for hva som skjer med autorisasjons API i overgangen mellom Altinn 2 og Altinn 3. Planen vil bli endret underveis.

_Siden er under konstruksjon_

### Endringslogg

### Innledning

På disse sidene vil du finne oversikt over alle API-tjenestene knyttet til autorisering og autentisering som finnes i Altinn 2 i dag.
Vi har delt API opp i to ulike brukergrupper og du finner migreringsstrategi for de ulike API-enedpunktene der:

- Tjenester for sluttbrukersystem
- Tjenester for tjenesteeiere i Altinn

## Ulike migrerings strategier for ulike API

Som en hovedregel så vil alle eksisterende API i Altinn 2 fortsette å fungere så lenge Altinn 2 plattformen er i drift.
Disse APIene vil som en hovedregel kun ha tilgang til informasjon fra Altinn 2 plattformen. Etterhvert som tjenesteeier flytter sine [ulike tjenester](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/migration/servicemigrationplan/) ut fra Altinn 2, så vil det være begrenset om man
får ut nødvendig informasjon fra APIene ettersom tjenestene forsvinner fra Altinn 2.

For API finnes 2 hovedstrategier i overgang mellom Altinn 2 og Altinn 3:

1. API tjenesten videreføres ikke i den form den er og nye API må tas i bruk når tjenester som system er avhengig av flyttes fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3
2. Det tilbys proxy for Altinn 2 API-tjeneste som igjen kaller nye API i Altinn 3. Disse vil være tilgjengelig i en overgangsfase og slås av på senere tidspunkt. Disse APIene vil som en hovedregel kunne hente ut informasjon om tjenester fra både Altinn 2 eller Altinn 3 plattformen. Proxyer kan f eks kreve at konsument må åpne brannmurer eller endrer adresse for kall som gjøres mot API.

Noen nye API vil være forholdsvis enkelt å ta i bruk og vil kreve lite endring i systemer som bruker APIene.
Men det vil også være tilfeller hvor nye API-tjenester endres mye og hvor det kreves større tilpasninger i systemer som konsumerer API.
I disse tilfellene vil vil beskrive hva endringene går ut på under beskrivelse av strategi for de ulike API-tjenestene.

## SOAP tjenester videreføres ikke

Altinn 2 tilbyr i dag API på både SOAP og REST. Det er besluttet at man som en hovedregel ikke vil videreføre SOAP grensesnitt på Altinn 3 plattformen.
Alle som i dag benytter SOAP må derfor forberede seg på at de er nødt til å gå over til REST.

Vi anbefaler de som i dag benytter SOAP å vente med å ta i bruk REST til nye REST-API er tilgjengelig i Altinn 3.

## Autentisering via Maskinporten blir innført for alle API i Altinn 3

Alle REST-api i Altinn 3 vil benytte Maskinporten som autentiseringsmekanisme. Det vil ikke være mulig å benytte virksomhetssertifikatpålogging direkte mot Altinn 3 REST-api, slik man har mulighet til i Altinn 2.

## Hva skjer med REST api for Sluttbrukersystem?

Disse APIene kan benyttes for å integrere fagsystemer mot Altinn som benyttes hos sluttbrukere.
Disse fagsysteme kan typisk være regnskapssystem, HR system, landbrukssystem, post/arkiv system eller lignende.

For å benytte disse APIene trengs en pålogget bruker som gir fagsystemet tilgang til å hente data på deres vegene i Altinn.
[Her finner du migreringsplaner for sluttbrukersystem-API](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/migration/api-migration/sbs-api/).

## Hva skjer med REST api for Tjenesteeier?

Disse APIene kan kun benyttes av offentlige virksomheter som har avtale om bruk av Altinn.

Det er tjenesteeier som autentiseres i kall mot API og kan hente ut informasjon om brukers fullmakter.
Tjenesteeier kan kun hente ut informasjon om bruker som er nødvendig for å kunne utføre offentlig myndighetsutøvelse/tjenesteyting.
[Her finner du migreringsplaner for tjenesteeeier-API](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/authorization/migration/api-migration/te-api/).

## Altinn OpenTelemetry Monitoring

# Monitoring

Altinn app instrumentation and monitoring.

We are migrating from using Application Insights SDK directly to using [OpenTelemetry (OTel)](https://opentelemetry.io/) as a vendor neutral
solution to instrumenting and shipping telemetry from apps. This still allows us to offer existing
Application Insights solution, but also enables developers to ship telemetry to custom monitoring solutions and vendors, and improve instrumentation and flexibility.
This means that these documentation pages are currently in active development and may be temporarily incomplete.

Setting up custom rules and alerts is currently not available to application owners,
but we are aiming to support this during the autumn of 2024.

To get started with monitoring in you app, see [instrumentation and monitoring user guide](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/guides/administration/monitor-and-instrument/).

This documentation contains information needed to support app developers and service owners in
operating, monitoring/observing and instrumenting applications on the Altinn 3 platform.

Altinn 3 uses the open and vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry specifications and protocols for instrumenting and shipping
telemetry end-to-end. This enables us to bring a baseline monitoring that serves all applications,
and enables service owners to make appropriate customizations as necessary, from custom enrichment and instrumentation
to completely separate monitoring platforms.

## Core concepts

**Instrumentation** is your software saying what it is doing.

**Telemetry** is making that information available, whether by pull—something asking—or push—sending messages; “measurement at a distance”.

**Monitoring** is receiving instrumentation and making it visible.

**Alerting** is reacting to the monitored data, or patterns in the data.

# About Altinn Studio

Altinn Studio a platform that lets you develop, operate, and manage public digital services for citizens and businesses.

The platform runs on a secure, isolated, and scalable infrastructure and is pre-integrated with a range of shared solutions and open APIs.
Altinn Studio supports both user interfaces for manual submission and APIs for machine-to-machine submission.

## What can I create with Altinn Studio?

With Altinn Studio, you can develop digital services that cover a broad spectrum of use cases - from simple form services
and information solutions to complex workflows with payment and signing functionality. The platform supports everything
from traditional forms to custom applications with advanced integrations.

See [detailed overview of use cases](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/about/usecases) for a description of the possibilities.

## Altinn Studio is the “connector”

A form is rarely just data fields to be submitted; more is needed to create a good service – e.g., connection
to ID-porten, submission to the case processing system or connection to national registers.

Altinn Studio has pre-developed integrations with several of Digdir’s shared services and national registers, and will
continue to develop and add more.

[![Altinn Studio is the “connector”](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/about/studio-i-midten.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/about/studio-i-midten.png) _Altinn Studio is the connector_

## Low-code and traditional code

Altinn Studio is a hybrid between low-code and traditional coding. This means you can start with low-code in Altinn Studio
Designer and switch to dedicated development tools like Visual Studio Code if you have advanced needs that require coding.

Our goal is to do as much as possible with low-code but retain the option for traditional coding and the flexibility
it provides. This allows non-technical resources to design and publish services without the need to involve developers.
At the same time, a developer can be brought in to create more advanced functionality that requires coding.

[![The tool supports both low-code and traditional coding](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/about/nocode_vs_coding.png)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/about/nocode_vs_coding.png) _The tool supports both low-code and traditional coding_

## Principles that Altinn Studio is built on

Here are some of the principles underlying our development of Altinn Studio.

- **Free and open-source code** because we genuinely believe that openness and the opportunity for others to contribute is the way to go for developing services in the public sector.
- **Based on open standards** because closed code ties you to a supplier and often entails additional costs.
- **Cloud-based infrastructure** where loose connections are sought without binding to a specific cloud provider.
- **Built on modern and popular frameworks/products** because it makes it easier for both us and our customers to acquire technical resources and because it’s something one wants to work with/learn.
- **Embedded security** where each layer in the architecture authorizes use regardless of where the calls come from.
- **Isolation** – Service owners get their own environments for testing and production.

### Open source and collaboration

Altinn Studio is not perfect, but it takes you a long way in creating good digital services - and we continuously add new functionality.

Instead of creating something on your own or buying something – why not contribute to the open-source project where there may be gaps
and thus give something back to the community?
The Altinn Studio teams handle quality assurance and ongoing code management.

Creating an environment around the development of services is important to us, and we now have a good number of contributors from
many public agencies contributing to advancing the product with us.
Contributions range from fixing typos that take seconds to fix to major components that have taken months.

An important part of creating an environment is the developer contact we have via Altinn Slack. Each service owner has their own
channel where questions can be asked.
We also see that service owners help each other and share experiences across organizations.
Backlog, user stories, plans, and roadmaps – everything is openly available on GitHub, providing both insight
and comments.

#### Governance

The Studio product consists of multiple components.
Here are core services and libraries that are owned and governed by the Studio team:

- [Studio Designer](https://altinn.studio/)
  - New features and bugfixes are continuously deployed on a daily basis
  - Development and work is tracked [in the Altinn/altinn-studio GitHub repository](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio)
- App libraries - [Altinn.App.Api, Altinn.App.Core](https://github.com/Altinn/app-lib-dotnet) and [the frontend](https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react)
  - Libraries hosted on NuGet.org. All Studio apps reference these libraries
  - Versioned using [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/). Prereleases consist of `preview` and `rc` (release candidate) stages. When `rc` stage is reached we intend to only do bug fixes and patching until stabilization
  - HTTP APIs described in the app via OpenAPI specifications have their own versioning scheme. API changes here occur in line with major version changes in the rest of the app (the libraries). Note that there may be APIs that are _not_ described in OpenAPI specifications; these are intended for internal use and we may make changes to these without any communication.
  - Development and work is tracked [in the Altinn/app-lib-dotnet](https://github.com/Altinn/app-lib-dotnet) and [Altinn/app-frontend-react](https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react) GitHub repositories
- Localtest - [local copy of core Altinn platform APIs](https://github.com/Altinn/app-localtest)
  - New features and bugfixes are continuously deployed as needed
  - Development and work is tracked [in the Altinn/app-localtest GitHub repository](https://github.com/Altinn/app-localtest)

The apps themselves are owned and operated by the owning organisation.

## Altinn Studio Production Deployment
What are you looking for?

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Deployment of apps to production

App owners can deploy their applications themselves.

## Getting access to a production environment

Before you can deploy an application to the production environment for the first time, a separate cluster for the service owner needs to be provisioned.

To get the cluster provisioned, the following process applies:

1. [Send an e-mail](mailto:tjenesteeier@digdir.no) with a message about which apps you have ready for deployment to production.
2. [Confirm that service owner accepts the terms of use](https://digdir.apps.altinn.no/digdir/godkjenn-bruksvilkaar)
3. Wait for a reply that cluster is created.

This routine just needs to be followed once. When the cluster is set up, the solution is 100% self-serviced afterwards.

## Deployment of app to production

Deploy of an application to production is done in [the same way as for test environments](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/testing/deploy).
The user that performs the deploy must be a member of the `Deploy-Production` team for their organisation in Altinn Studio.
Administrating access to teams in Altinn Studio is done by the owners of your organisation.

## Order “About form”-page on altinn.no

Altinn maintains [an overview of all services](https://www.altinn.no/skjemaoversikt/).
In order for Altinn User Service to be able to help users with a service, information must be entered here. To ensure effective communication with Altinn user service and a seamless allocation of rights to the service, it is crucial to register the exact same name on both the “About form’-page and in the App.
The order form is called _“Publiser informasjon om tjeneste på Altinn PROD og TT02”_, and can be found after login on [altinndigtal.no](https://altinndigital.no/).

**NB!** The form is currently optimized for Altinn II services. Therefore, do the following:

- In the field _“Tjenestekode”_, enter 9999 and in the field _“Utgavekode”_ enter 9999.
- In the field _“Hvem skal bruke skjemaet”_ remember to specify which roles are required for using the app in addition to the description of who the app is meant for.

## Altinn Integration Capabilities
What are you looking for?

# Integration & Data Transport Capabilties

The most important capability for a platform like Altinn 3 is the integration capabilites.

In many ways you can say that Altinn is a integration hub for communication between the citizens, the businesses and the public
entities in Norway.

[![Integration parties](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/capabilities/runtime/integration/integration_capabilities.svg)](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/architecture/capabilities/runtime/integration/integration_capabilities.svg) _integration actors_

Data flows between the different actors using Altinns.

- Citizens receives data from the public agencies and sends data to the public agencies
- Business receives data from the public agencies and sends data to the public agencies
- Public agencies can share data with other public agencies
- ++

### End-point enablement

Applications created in Altinn Studio has build in API for communication with the different actors. In addition
application developers can add their custom APIS.

The different platform components exposes API to applications and external parties.

All this is possible because the backend framework let developers create and expose APIS.
This also include app developers that create applications in Altinn Studio.

In the same way the different applications and components consumes APIS from other sources both inside the Altinn 3 platform solutions
and external sources.

The APIS exposed as standard from Apps and platform is described [here](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/api)

### Publish & Subscribe

A important change for Altinn moving to the new platform is we change to an event driven architecture.

As part of the Altinn 3 platform it is created an Events component that apps and other can publish their events and other can
subscribe to.

### Transport & Delivery

The different solutions of the platform support transport & delivery of the data.

By default the clients are the active parts for transporting data. Agencies needs to push data to Altinn when it need to send data to other actors, and need to pull data when receiving data.

The only active push from Altinn is when Altinn Platform Events component send events to subscribers.

## Dialogporten Write Actions
What are you looking for?

# Write actions

Learn how write actions are used to provide a more integrated user experience

## Introduction

Write actions are a way to allow GUI actions to perform a state changing operation directly from browser based end-user systems without the need for a full page navigation, allowing for a more cohesive user experience.

## Background

All [actions](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/dialogs#actions) defined on a dialog are effectively URLs pointing to the service provider system that must be requested in some way by the end-user system when the user indicates that action is to be performed. While custom end-user systems implementing [API-actions](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/dialogs#api-actions) can invoke both read and write operations using all available HTTP methods and input/output models, browser based end-user systems implementing [GUI-actions](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/dialogs#api-actions) are by default constrained to read operations (ie. navigate to a page, or download a file) using HTTP GET methods.

Cross-origin full page navigation is perhaps the most central feature of the web, and is, unlike “state changing” operations such as HTTP POSTs, not constrained by web browsers due to security reasons. This is what makes it possible to implement [single-sign-on](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/idporten/oidc/oidc_func_sso) mechanisms in ID-porten and session initialization (all of which involves several browser redirects) at the remote service provider system. This allows for seamless deep-linking between browser based end-user systems (eg. Arbeidsflate) and the user-facing GUI parts of the service provider systems.

However, performing a cross-origin POST, ie. submitting a form to an endpoint on a different server, while relying on the same SSO and session intialization mechanisms is (both in modern web browsers as well as in ID-porten) not possible. This is by design, and to avoid security issues stemming from [cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).

Custom end user systems utilizing the API actions and Maskinporten/system user authentication are not constrained by this, as these are security measures put in place by web browsers, and not inherently constraints of the HTTP protocol.

This is usually not a problem, as most GUI-actions in Dialogporten are meant to be full page navigations, such as “Go to form fill-out”, where all the state changing operations are implemented. But some actions does not require any particular input, nor does it produce any particularly interesting output. Actions such as “Confirm message read” or “Cancel process”, would with a normal GUI action require the user to 1) perform a full page navigation to the remote system, 2) perform the actual state changing operation there, and wait for a confirmation before 3) navigating back to the (now presumably updated) dialog.

While this works, it is not a very cohesive user experience as it involves intermediate steps and navigations, which from a user point of might seem unnecessary.

## The solution

As with [front channel embeds](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/front-channel-embeds/), write actions leverage the [dialog token](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/dialogporten/getting-started/authorization/dialog-tokens/) mechanism to allow browser based enduser system to directly invoke the URL associated with the action in the background, ie. without performing a full page navigation. While the request is undergoing, the end user system might show a spinner or similar progress indicator. Upon completion, end-users will be presented with the updated dialog view. In case of errors (either technical or business logic-related), an error message can be displayed.

Dialogporten does not know the semantics associated with an action, so for actions that involve complex mutations of the dialog, the service owner must perform the change, update the dialog in the background, and then return a successful response in the request made by the end-user system. This will trigger the end-user to reload the (now updated) dialog from Dialogporten, and display the new state to the user. There are also mechanisms to allow the for the dialog change to occur asynchronously (delayed) and independent on the request made by the end-user system, transparent to the end-user. See the reference section for technical details.

## Altinn Studio Payment
What are you looking for?

Clear

Last modified: Sep 29, 2025

# Payment

It is possible to configure user payment for services that are fee-based or where it is allowed to charge a fee.

Payment is a process step that can be added to the application.
When entering the payment step, the user is redirected to an external payment provider, and is returned to the service once the payment is completed.

The order details and payment information are stored in a data element as JSON (paymentInformation.json), and can be downloaded via API after the form is submitted. A PDF receipt is also generated.
The service owner is responsible for handling the retention of payment information in accordance with the Norwegian bookkeeping laws (Bokføringsloven).

## Nets Easy

Support for using Nets Easy as a payment provider comes with the application. Guidance on setting up Nets Easy can be found [here](https://docs.altinn.studio/en/altinn-studio/v8/guides/development/payment/).

The service owner must have a Nets Easy agreement.
You can find information on how to create the agreement here: [payments.nets.eu](https://payments.nets.eu/en-GB/checkout).

## Additional Payment Processors

You can add more payment processors using custom backend code.
Multiple payment processors can be used side by side in the same service.
Contact us if this is relevant for you.
