Extract key technical concepts from this user input to create a focused semantic search query.

User Input (may be Norwegian):
{user_input}

Generate a concise English query (2-5 key technical terms) that captures:
- Technical PATTERNS and APPROACHES (e.g., "authorization policy role requirement", "conditional rendering hidden expressions")
- Altinn-specific BEHAVIORS (e.g., "datamodel bindings", "validation rules", "prefill mapping", "access control")
- Implementation CONCEPTS (e.g., "expressions", "triggers", "data sources", "XACML policy")

DO NOT include specific component types - focus on technical concepts and behaviors.
Focus on HOW things work, not WHAT components exist.

Output ONLY the search query, nothing else. No explanations.

Example good queries:
- "authorization policy configuration skip role requirement organization access"
- "conditional rendering hidden expressions dynamic visibility"
- "validation rules required expressions datamodel"
- "prefill configuration data sources mapping"
- "nested conditions visibility triggers"
