* This will give the map an (almost) correct width for A4 paper before calling print.
* Since it has @media only screen it will still scale to fit the page,
* but the initial fitBounds will not depend on the PDF-service's browser viewport
* Ideally, the browser's viewport would match the pages aspect ratio, as
* geometries could still be cut off for extremely narrow pages, and would have a lot of
* space on the right side for a landscape print, but for all "normal" portrait page formats
* this should work well.
* Additionally, for very wide pages the map tiles on the far right will not have a chance to
* load before the page prints, but you should at least see the relevant area.
