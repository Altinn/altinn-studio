# API Models Information

This folder has the C# models used for the Nets Easy API.

## Overview

These models were manually created based on the JSON examples in the Nets API documentation. Since they were written by
hand, there might be some unintentional differences from the actual API objects.

## API Reference

The models are based on the following API documentation:

- [Nets Easy Payment API](https://developer.nexigroup.com/nexi-checkout/en-EU/api/payment-v1/)

## Notes

- **Manual Creation**: Since these were manually created, there could be some mismatches between the models and the
  actual API.
- **Check for Updates**: Refer back to the official API docs for the most up-to-date information.
