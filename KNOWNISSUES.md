Altinn.studio has now reached the first MVP milestone, and service developers (especially for pilot projects) are welcome to start using the solution to create services that should be released.

There are some known errors and weaknesses in the solution.

## Major issues

- The solution is not yet optimized for users using keyboard navigation and/or are visually impared
- The container functionality in the UI editor should be considered experimental. It can be used, but will be percieved as buggy
- Drag-and-drop functionality in the UI editor is sometimes unpredictable, especially in cases where the container functionality is used
- There are currently two menues for navigating the solution, and the functionality you need are spread between them
- All services (repositories) from the MTP period (before January 21 2019) have been deleted, as there were breaking changes to service functionality

## Minor issues worth mentioning

- The visual difference between the different components in the UI-editor is smaller than ideal
- You are able to edit (a local copy of) a service you don't have writing privileges to. You are, however, not able to publish those changes
- Some parts of the Altinn Studio UI will reload while navigating, which may cause blinking and/or text string IDs being shown temporarily
