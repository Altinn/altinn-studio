# Language support

We currently are planning to add support for English and Norwegian in Altinn Studio. Since this is not implemented,
this might seem like premature optimization. But we know that this is something that we will add at a point in the future.

This workspace contains the language files and any tests of quality that we might introduce.

## Sorting

We require the text files to be sorted alphabetically by key in order to make it easier to find the text one is looking
for, and to avoid merge conflicts. To sort the files, run the following command from this directory:

```bash
yarn run sort
```
