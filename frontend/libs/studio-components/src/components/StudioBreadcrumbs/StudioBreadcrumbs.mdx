# StudioBreadcrumbs

This is a copy of Designsystemet's `Breadcrumb` component from v1.0.0-next.35. It should eventually be replaced with an import from Designsystemet when we upgrade to v1.

`StudioBreadcrumbs` is a navigation with a visible breadcrumb trail. Use this component to help users understand where they are within a structure, such as on a website. This allows them to more easily switch between the different levels of the structure.

<Controls of={StudioBreadcrumbsStories.Preview} />

## How to use `Breadcrumb`

The last link in the breadcrumb trail is automatically marked with `aria-current="page"`.

```tsx
<Breadcrumbs aria-label='You are here:'>
  <Breadcrumbs.List>
    <Breadcrumbs.Item>
      <Breadcrumbs.Link href='https://designsystemet.no/'>Level 1</Breadcrumbs.Link>
    </Breadcrumbs.Item>
    <Breadcrumbs.Item>
      <Breadcrumbs.Link href='https://designsystemet.no/niva-2/'>Level 2</Breadcrumbs.Link>
    </Breadcrumbs.Item>
  </Breadcrumbs.List>
</Breadcrumbs>
```
