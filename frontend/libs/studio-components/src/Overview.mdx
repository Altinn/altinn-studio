# Studio components

Welcome to the Studio components storybook!
This documentation serves as a guide to understand and utilize the components available within our internal library, Studio Components.

## Introduction

Studio Components is an internal library developed for Team Altinn Studio to facilitate the construction of the UI for our no-code tool.
These components are built on top of `@digir/designsystemet` to implement to our specific needs. We leverage the components provided by the designsystemet and compose them together to
create more complex components to be more useful to our use cases.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Studio Components is to streamline the development process within Team Altinn Studio. By using Studio Components, we can easily create and manage complex UI components without having to reinvent the wheel for
each feature implementation. The team is using this approach to gain consistency between pages and design-concepts. Additionally, Studio Components serves as a facade, simplifying updates from the designsystemet and allowing us to have greater control over third-party libraries.
