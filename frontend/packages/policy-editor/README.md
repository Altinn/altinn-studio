# Policy Editor

This is the `policy editor`-package. The package is supposed to render an editor component
that can be used to view and modify policies for apps and resources. The editor displays all
rules available in the policy, and makes it possible to add more rules, delete rules, and
clone rules.
The editor makes use of a list of possible actions, as well as a list of possible subjects,
that can be assigned to the policy, which must be provided through its props when using the
component.

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  PolicyEditor,
  PolicyActionType,
  PolicyBackendType,
  PolicySubjectType,
} from '@altinn/policy-editor';

const exampleActions: PolicyActionType[] = [
  { actionId: 'read', actionTitle: 'Les', actionDescription: null },
  { actionId: 'write', actionTitle: 'Skriv', actionDescription: null },
  { actionId: 'delete', actionTitle: 'Slett', actionDescription: null },
];

const exampleSubjects: PolicySubjectType[] = [
  {
    subjectDescription: 'Daglig leder fra enhetsregisteret',
    subjectId: 'DAGL',
    subjectSource: 'altinn:rolecode',
    subjectTitle: 'Daglig leder',
  },
  {
    subjectDescription: 'Regnskapsfører',
    subjectId: 'REGNA',
    subjectSource: 'altinn:rolecode',
    subjectTitle: 'Regnskapsfører',
  },
];

const examplePolicyData: PolicyPolicyBackendType = {
    requiredAuthenticationLevelEndUser: '3',
    requiredAuthenticationLevelOrg: '3',
    rules: [
      ruleId: 'urn:altinn:example:ruleid:1',
      description: 'Policy description',
      actions: ['read', 'write'],
      resources:['urn:altinn:org:[ORG]', 'urn:altinn:app:[APP]'],
      subject: ['urn:altinn:rolecode:DAGL'],
    ],
  };

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleSavePolicy = (policy: PolicyBackendType) => {}

  return (
    <PolicyEditor
      policy={examplePolicyData}
      actions={exampleActions}
      subjects={exampleSubjects}
      onSave={handleSavePolicy}
      showAllErrors={false}
      usageType='app'
    />
  );
};
```
