This is written in plain javascript. This is because we want server startup to be faster. No need to a compile step.
It also makes the setup simpler.

At the moment this is just mocking out whats needed to run the datamodelling-part of the solution.

### Datamodelling

It should cover enough features to have this running

### Deployment

Basic features to get the deployment page up is covered. Still need to simulate deploys
with correct statuses and so on. But atm this solves the pressing issues
