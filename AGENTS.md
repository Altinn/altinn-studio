## Altinn Studio

Altinn Studio is a product for developing, operating, and managing public digital services for citizens and businesses in Norway.
It runs on a secure, isolated, scalable platform integrated with common shared services and open APIs, and supports both user-facing submissions and machine-to-machine APIs.

You can build anything from simple form services to complex workflows with payments and signing.
It is a hybrid of low-code and traditional code, so you can start in Designer and switch to full-code tools when needed.

Key principles include open source, open standards, cloud-based infrastructure, modern frameworks, built-in security, and tenant isolation.
